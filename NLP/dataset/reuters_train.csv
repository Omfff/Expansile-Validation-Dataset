1,"U.S. WHEAT GROWERS WANT EEP TO SOVIET UNION
  The U.S. National Association of
  Wheat Growers (NAWG) urged the Reagan administration offer the
  Soviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program (eep).
      In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWG
  stated its ""strong support"" for an eep offer to Moscow.
      ""We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet
  EEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Soviet
  purchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness to
  purchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced,"" NAWG said.
      ""Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S.
  eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure
  mutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grain
  agreement,"" the letter said.

1,"AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92
  A 0/92 program would have very
  little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only
  an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according
  to a report from the Agriculture Department.
      The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres
  idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35
  mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln
  dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.
      The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92
  acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.
  Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.
      ""The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very
  large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite
  small,"" the report said.
      ""The returns on typical farms still favor participation in
  the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted
  acreage,"" the USDA report said.
      The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego
  planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,
  would be most used by producers in high production/high risk
  areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,
  director of USDA's economics analysis staff.
      ""In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much
  participation,"" Collins said.
      USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat
  would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000
  acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.
      Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40
  mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels
  of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of
  cotton, the report said.
      ""In determining whether to participate, a producer would
  need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the
  loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the
  expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be
  considered,"" according to the analysis.
      ""What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between
  the loan rate and the cost of production,"" Collins said.
      For producers with low production costs, that difference is
  greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.
  Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along
  with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more
  attractive.
      Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be
  more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.
      ""I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at
  first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating
  production decisions from government payments,"" Collins said.
      In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and
  Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too
  late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will
  be over by the end of this month.

  Zambia's talks with the World Bank and
  International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package
  have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an
  official newspaper said.
      The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United
  National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as
  saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing
  food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how
  it proposes to pay for them.
      President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies
  last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move
  caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots.
      The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to
  quell the disturbances.
      The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the
  government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the
  remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.
      The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to
  the private sector has been suspended since the end of January,
  pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and
  dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.
      The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction,
  losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months, but since the end of
  January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar.
      Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank
  and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar
  on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.

  Unfavorable late winter weather
  conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia
  indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,
  the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.
      The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to
  Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop
  had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell
  that followed a period of warm weather.
      He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that
  brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was
  followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.
      Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which
  show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf
  and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.
      The report said that since much of the early growth in
  February was from late seeding rather than from normal
  development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive
  than some local observers say.
      The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields
  on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and
  chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.
      However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable
  and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which
  would aid recovery.

      Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the
  non-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavy
  enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big
  percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for
  a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.
      Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of
  the total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program.
      USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown:

"
1,"OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED
  The results of a controversial study
  of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the
  highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy
  farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from
  subsidies.
      Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD
  because of objections from some countries, were provided to
  Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not
  be identified.
      The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for
  the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer
  subsidy equivalent, PSE.
      The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or the
  amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged
  83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pct
  and the United States 48.2 pct.
      For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and
  the U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC
  13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.
      In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct
  compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.
  Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC
  and 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.
      For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the
  EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.
      The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial
  countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most
  cases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and
  Japan, the sources said.
      Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing
  country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD
  work.
      Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to
  release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD
  ministerial meeting in Paris during May.
      Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a 
  basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade
  talks now underway in Geneva.
      British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit
  to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting
  point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.
      He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate
  down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of
  the present crisis in world agriculture.
      However, the OECD study results are controversial because
  they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials
  familiar with the study said.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service
  recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to
  verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.
      In some cases the results were substantially different than
  the OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and
  elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base
  period of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.
      For example, the USDA study found the United States
  subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49
  pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.
      French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,
  citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told
  reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its
  farmers more than the EC.
      However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably
  higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.
      Officials of several countries have been asked to
  contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to
  1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the
  current world farm situation.
      The updated calculations, which may take several months to
  complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.
  subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive
  import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.
      U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm
  bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to
  grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials
  added.

      In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency

      Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal
  throughout all grain areas, stressing grain-filling corn in
  areas receiving lightest rainfall, it said.
      The agency said rainfall during February was near to above

  Canada's ruling in favor of a duty on
  U.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn
  Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other
  nations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for the
  association.
      ""The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and
  just change corn to corn gluten feed"" in their complaint, Hall
  told Reuters.
      A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm
  policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and
  supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85
  cts per bushel.
      ""This was cleary a political decision,"" Hall said. ""The
  amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant.""
      The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument
  that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and
  that American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus
  causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government
  payments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.
      Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that
  other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack
  U.S. farm programs.
      The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm
  programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall
  said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of
  U.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the
  imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.

1,"GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN
  Implementation of a one-year 0/92
  pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted
  today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee
  as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers
  another option when making their planting decisions.
      ""We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,
  but we are locked into this,"" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),
  chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed
  grains. ""We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the
  farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.""
      Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill
  for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman
  said that it will probably be introduced next week.
      Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to
  forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency
  payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --
  only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under
  the current bill.
      It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,
  he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet
  budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than
  sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.
      A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a
  different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.
      Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government
  payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this
  point, he said.
      ""I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a
  decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,"" Glickman said
  at the hearing.
      Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the
  Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term
  0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.
      Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His
  plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to
  participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to
  conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra
  idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres
  in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.
      ""I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but
  we can at least move in that direction,"" Boschwitz said.
      Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified
  in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias
  in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'
  dependency on the government, he said.
      A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson
  said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.
      Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and
  the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose
  any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the
  farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.
      But when asked if his association were forced to choose
  between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry
  Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92
  rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

  A proposal by two U.S. House

  Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture
  Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. ""This is the
  first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative
  to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal.""
      The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron
  Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs
  per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive
  deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not
  more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.
      The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20
  pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not
  actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.
      Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five
  years, protect family farms and eliminate government
  accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be
  halted.
      However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would
  ""involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a
  family farmer is.""
      Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program
  payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.
      Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill
  would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and

"
1,"PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER
  Pakistan is not emerging as a major
  wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,
  Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the
  Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.
      No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and
  plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing
  because they could not agree a price, he said.
      Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses
  of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few
  harvests in years when the weather is favourable.
      The government does not wish to increase output much above
  this because of low world prices, and the land would be better
  used for other crops.
      Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown
  to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some
  10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to
  more profitable crops such as oilseeds.
      The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the
  current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha
  over the next five to seven years, he said.
      Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is
  just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln
  tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's
  yield of 14.0 mln.
      He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more
  recent rains reduced prospects slightly.
      The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln
  tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual
  population growth rate of more than three pct. Current
  consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.
      The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.
  This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln
  tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a
  ""strategic reserve"" target of two mln tonnes.
      Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over
  target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.
      The government wants to keep an extra ""safety margin"" until
  it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat
  rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports
  will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88
  crop can be gauged as well, he said.
      The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the
  government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two
  rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in
  Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.
      Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and
  due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were
  issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.
      Aziz said following the introduction of a government
  support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that
  only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the
  consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.
      The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect
  on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.
      Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of
  the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive
  Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March
  1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.
      Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a
  major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better
  use of side-products such as bran.

0,"PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER
  Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro
  Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state
  grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import
  tenders open to private traders.
      Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted
  to the tenders.
      Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the
  European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC
  (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced
  by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.
      Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's
  civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month
  that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done,
  in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.
      As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March
  12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.
      Barreto said, ""My objective is put EPAC into the tenders
  because it has a right to take part."" He added the government
  would be studying the court order to see whether or not the
  ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.
      Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator,
  whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders
  had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the
  Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.
      ""There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,""
  Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had
  accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.
      The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in
  the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the
  clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the
  gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

  Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's fourth conservation signup is expected to be
  announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be
  higher than total enrollment for the first three signups.
      Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,
  USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in
  the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.
      Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into
  the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's
  Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a
  congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be
  accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.
      As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is
  expected to attract the greatest enrollment.
      ""The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which
  we'll get signup in,"" a USDA conservation specialist said.
      Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the
  acreage pulled from that area, he said.
      Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage
  in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,
  but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small
  percent of the total.
      A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part
  of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more
  interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.
      Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take
  land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment
  accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre.

  French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is

  capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one
  issue of shares and investment certificates to finance
  expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts.
      For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new
  65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln
  francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000
  new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400
  francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.
      The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2
  billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans.
  These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products
  maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes
  said.
      Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of
  Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French
  plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West
  Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands
  and Denmark.
      Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the
  installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the
  Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes
  said.
      If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and
  developing two other French plants, either in the maize or
  wheat starch sector.
      Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion
  for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its
  capital increase.
      Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of
  Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year,
  has been holding talks with other European companies on
  possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be

  Despite earlier optimistic
  indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage
  in its development and recent reports of heat stress could
  reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
  department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87
  (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct
  from the previous year.
      The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a
  period of severe droughts, which at one point required South
  Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it
  said.
      Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing

  The European Commission has not taken a
  decision on applications from the British government for the
  release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the
  British market in May and June, Commission sources said.
      They said last week's cereals management committee agreed
  to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders
  between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to
  allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.
      However, it decided to leave consideration of the release
  of further wheat until later.
      The British government had applied for the release of a
  further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British
  intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.
      However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review
  the market situation nearer the time before giving its
  approval.
      The Commission was given new powers last year to control
  the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the
  sources noted.
      Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry
  of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that
  additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made
  available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged
  that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,
  depending on the state of the market.
      This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission
  had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the
  three months of April, May and June at last week's meeting.

"
0,"COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS
  Congress, eager to find budget
  savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's
  generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA
  and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how
  much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.
      The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that
  payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20
  pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked
  not to be identified said.
      USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying
  it did not take into account storage, handling and transport
  savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to
  re-examine the costs, sources said.
      The issue is an important one, because congressional budget
  committees are known to be considering limiting the use of
  certificates as a means of cutting spending.
      Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior
  Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the
  Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.
      Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are
  uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared
  to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,
  CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.
      USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents
  to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in
  government storage.
      It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative
  arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the
  government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm
  price and income support programs, Reagan administration
  sources said.
      The GAO is expected to point out that use of
  payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight
  storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been
  sold.
      The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director
  Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees
  intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal
  budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of
  PIK certificates.
      The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or
  certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to
  farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to
  repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or
  cash.
      Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion
  dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another
  6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and
  August 1987, according to USDA.
      Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily
  because recipients can use the certificates to pay back
  government loans at levels below the loan rate.
      Eliminating this practice, called ""PIK and roll,"" would save
  the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to
  the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according
  to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates
  cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.
      The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be
  considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other
  savings alternatives.
      The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the
  estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date
  have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln
  dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one
  administration official said.
      However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates
  based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.
      The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable
  to the different effect certificates can have on market prices
  over the course of a crop year.
      USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found
  that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of
  corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by
  between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.
      Between September and November, however, certificates had
  only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS
  study, obtained by Reuters.

  the current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see if
  it will work as hoped.
      Corn and soybean basis values continued to drop on the

  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26
  mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.
      In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said
  the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the
  U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and
  coarse grain from other major suppliers.
      USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one
  mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the
  preliminary 1985/86 figure.
      Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln
  tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with
  a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a
  cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.
      USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly
  from the previous January's level, while milk production
  increased by nearly six pct.
      Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in
  roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock

  There are heightened fears that ""El
  Nino"" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the
  1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continents
  and caused widespread damage through floods and drought, the
  U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a field
  report.
      Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,
  flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to
  increased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.
      However, it said official sources still believe that this
  year's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.
      EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and
  waters in the pacific.
      The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being
  experienced has not had an overall negative impact on
  agricultural production.
      Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce
  yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the
  crop cycle.
      Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where
  excessive moisture exists, it said.
      However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply
  of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve
  prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, and
  slow the decline in sugar production, it said.
      If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry could
  receive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish
  catch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in
  1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.
      Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three
  to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high
  enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.
      It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will
  intensify and carry on through late March, April and May
  causing problems as crops approach harvest.
      ""There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino
  -- only time will tell,"" the report said.

  subsidies.
      Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD

      The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or the

  83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pct
  and the United States 48.2 pct.
      For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and
  the U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC
  13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.
      In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct
  compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.
  Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC
  and 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.
      For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the
  EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.
      The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial
  countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most
  cases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and
  Japan, the sources said.
      Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing
  country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD
  work.
      Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to
  release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD
  ministerial meeting in Paris during May.
      Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a 
  basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade
  talks now underway in Geneva.
      British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit
  to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting
  point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.
      He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate
  down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of
  the present crisis in world agriculture.
      However, the OECD study results are controversial because
  they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials
  familiar with the study said.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service
  recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to
  verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.
      In some cases the results were substantially different than
  the OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and
  elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base
  period of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.
      For example, the USDA study found the United States
  subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49
  pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.
      French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,
  citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told
  reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its
  farmers more than the EC.
      However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably
  higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.
      Officials of several countries have been asked to
  contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to
  1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the
  current world farm situation.
      The updated calculations, which may take several months to
  complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.
  subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive
  import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.
      U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm
  bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to
  grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials
  added.

  The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)
  will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn
  syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
  (CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.
      Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange
  expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has
  been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in
  December, 1985.
      The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of
  55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank
  truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet
  milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most
  commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other
  beverages.
      Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production
  facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated
  by the symbol ""HF,"" would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months
  traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of
  March, May, July, September and December.
      Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a
  minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation
  of one dlr per CWT.
      ""We hope the producers and users of fructose will be
  actively involved, those producers being the large processors,
  the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage
  bottlers,"" Henderson said. ""But there are potentials for all
  types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries
  that utilize fructose.""

1,"U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION
  All major grain producing countries
  must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the
  recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.
  wheat organizations said.
      The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point
  for discussions, ""but we do not want the Australians to feel
  they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions"" on world
  grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat
  Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said
  in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
      Future discussions on international wheat trade should
  include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of
  government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public
  disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are
  involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.
  have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the
  two organizations said 
      While the Australian proposals are welcome the two
  organizations said they are not in total agreement with their
  assessments.
      Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target
  prices and ""quarantine"" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to
  place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.
  farmers, they said.
        Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted
  from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.
  acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.
      ""We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and
  subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking
  grain and changing programs which protect our growers,"" Jim
  Miller, president of NAWG said.
      ""We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the
  world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and
  restore profitability to agriculture,"" Miller said.

"
0,"U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH
  U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)
  figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation
  Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral
  to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown
  would be needed to assess the full price impact.
      ""Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in
  corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the
  trade was looking for,"" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham
  Lambert said.
      The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into
  the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837
  acres.
      Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of
  planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but
  some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates
  slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions
  figures March 31.
      Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program
  recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage
  to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.
      Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,
  said there was not enough information to completely assess the
  conservation figures. ""The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly
  disappointing,"" he added.
      The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the
  enrollment figures.
      Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for
  both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an
  upward adjustment in planting intention figures.
      Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates
  onto the market this spring, he said: ""The trade was definitely
  looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than
  expected.""
      The USDA offered a special corn ""bonus"" rental payment to
  the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus
  amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program
  payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the
  reserve.
      Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said
  the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had
  expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were
  considerably higher than the actual figures.
      ""I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the
  long run,"" she said.
      Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some
  confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure
  between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or
  the latest addition.
      ""It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid
  into the program,"" she said.
      Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas
  about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation
  sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as
  61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the
  high 60's.
      Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight
  reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to
  around 64 mln acres.
      New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed
  earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program,
  despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor
  yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to
  final production figures.

  said in the past seven weeks reported U.S. corn sales of nearly
  three mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the level

"
1,"SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS
  Secretary of State George Shultz has
  decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
  Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
  subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
  Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
      ""Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
  last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
  basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
  they want to do,"" the official said.
      If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
  Soviet Union, he said, ""Shultz will not wage a vigorous
  campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
  he won't go to the President and voice his objections.""
      In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
  yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
  Growers, the State Department said, ""Secretary Shultz expressed
  his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
  competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
      The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
  determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
  extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
  Program.""
      Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
  Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
  Moscow, the State Department official said.
      ""Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
  subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
  firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.""
      USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
  USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
  wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
      The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
  that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
  U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
      The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
  State Department source said.
      ""What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
  lowest price being paid by anyone in the world,"" he said.
      The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
  U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
      Government and commodity sources also said there are
  elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
  Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
      ""Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
  foregone conclusion,"" the State Department official said.
  

"
0,"ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER
  Argentine grain producers again
  reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87
  soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,
  trade sources said.
      They said growers now forecast soybean production this
  season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's
  estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln
  tonnes forecast in mid-February.
      The new forecast is still higher than last season's record
  total production.
      Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to
  7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast
  for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1
  mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.
      Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods
  in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe
  provinces and northern Buenos Aires.
      The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures
  and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty
  pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to
  3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86
  record of 3.34 mln hectares.
      The state of the crop continued to be good in general until
  last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused
  damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.
      Where the rains were less heavy they were considered
  beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.
      The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in
  southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to
  influence production forecasts.
      In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where
  rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize
  and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.
      The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by
  rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La
  Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.
      The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and
  3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln
  hectares in 1985/86.
      The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at
  between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.
      This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to
  12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production
  and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.
      The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the
  area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires
  although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.
      A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is
  impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of
  sunshine dries the fields.
      The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down
  29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.
      Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3
  to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln tonnes.
      The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the
  rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting
  in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.
      The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2
  pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.
      Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to
  22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

  report.
      The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of

  because of dry conditions.
      However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
  promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on
  last fall's late seeding, it said.
      Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the
  situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out
  of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the
  report said.
      Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage
  under these conditions, they said.

  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade

      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,

  Drought has resulted in a reduction
  in China's estimated wheat crop this year to 87.0 mln tonnes,
  2.0 mln below last year's harvest, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Peking said in a field report.
      The report, dated March 25, said imports in the 1987/88
  season are projected at 8.0 mln tonnes, 1.0 mln tonnes above
  the the current season's estimate.
      Imports from the United States are estimated at 1.5 mln
  tonnes compared to only 150,000 tonnes estimated for the
  1986/87 year, it said.
      After travelling to major wheat producing areas and
  obtaining more information on the planted area, the total
  planted area was estimated down 290,000 hectares due to the dry
  fall, it said.
      The report said to compensate for the below normal
  precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of
  fertilizer.
      While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible,
  most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore
  has emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said.
      It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past
  10 days has improved the situation but information on hail
  damage in Anhui is incomplete.

1,"U.S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER
  The U.S. House Agriculture Committee
  approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement
  Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan
  administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.
      The proposals were approved as amendments to a
  comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.
      In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee
  approved several proposals which could restrict imports of
  lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those
  amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because
  the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall
  jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,
  Congressional sources said.
      The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the
  life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than
  the current three years through fiscal 1988.
      The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also
  would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from
  1.5 billion now.
      Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by
  Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department
  to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition
  value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct
  less expensive to operate.
      The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by
  Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration
  make an offer, but urges such action.
      The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn
  English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to
  begin discussions with other major grain producing countries
  aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.
      Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the
  amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.
      Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved
  by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on
  imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm
  product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered
  by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at
  curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and
  foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect
  peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.
      Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of
  casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New
  Zealand and Ireland.
      The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same
  countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.
  beef imports.
      Other miscellaneous amendments included:
      -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against
  Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove
  restrictions on beef imports.
      -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped
  each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to
  800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.
      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of
  the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to
  determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.
      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the
  National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the
  costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a
  Canadian countervailing duty case this year.
      -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision
  to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the
  European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.
      -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National
  Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a
  reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

"
1,"SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER
  Speculation the United States will
  offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
  reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
  State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
      Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
  markets since officials from the two countries held their
  customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
  decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
  strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
      Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
      Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
  the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
  Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
  Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
  here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
  preparing an offer.
      Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
  Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
  about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
      But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
  contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
  while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility.
      Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
  asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
  offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
      Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
  are saying they would not rule one out.
      Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
  predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
  to two weeks.
      Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
  who had been in contact with administration officials.
      Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
  Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
  offer would be made by the middle of this month.
      Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
  up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
  year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
  per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
      Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
  subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
  U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
      As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
  would appear to be price.
      Last summer the administration took the controversial step
  of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
  embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
  that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
  far above world market prices.
      The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
  front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
  means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
  criticism, grain trade sources said.
      Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
  from saying the Soviets were ""chortling"" because Washington was
  offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
  U.S. housewives.
      The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
  here is that a general warming of relations between the two
  countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
  in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
      In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
  buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
      However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
  surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
  subsidy offer last summer.
      Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
  industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
  decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
  only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
      Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
  include only the Soviets.
      That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
  uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
  that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
  sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

1,"UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE
  Abnormally warm and dry weather over most
  parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News
  Agency said.
      It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in
  eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant
  diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing
  areas, it said.
      The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and
  other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than
  seven months.
      The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of
  water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,
  lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric
  power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and
  consumers.
      The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels
  in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making
  harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.
      The drought has also increased the number of forest fires.
  More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340
  hectares of forest by mid-February, it said.
  

"
1,"USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26
  mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.
      In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said
  the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the
  U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and
  coarse grain from other major suppliers.
      USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one
  mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the
  preliminary 1985/86 figure.
      Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln
  tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with
  a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a
  cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.
      USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly
  from the previous January's level, while milk production
  increased by nearly six pct.
      Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in
  roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock
  production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,
  USDA said.

  French exporters estimated that around
  600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for
  delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year.
      Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July
  1986 and February this year.
      Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during
  this month and around the same amount in April, they said.
      France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in
  1985/86, according to customs figures.
      However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of
  its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of
  U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January

1,"SHULTZ SAYS U.S. PRODUCTS MUST BE COMPETITIVE
  Asked what the U.S. State
  Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,
  Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders
  that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.
      ""If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may
  be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,""
  Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association
  of Wheat Growers.
      ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
  somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
  thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't,"" he
  said.
      ""That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,
  and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm
  program and try to figure out what we should do to make it
  better,"" Shultz told the Wheat Growers.
      Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that
  would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the
  American housewife, he realizes the importance of American
  agricultural products being competitively priced.
      Speculation has been in the market for some time that the
  United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union
  at subsidized prices.
      Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it
  were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials
  have declined to take any official position on the issue.

1,"U.S. FARM POLICY DEBATE COULD HIT SENATE SOON
  The Senate this week might take up
  proposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to
  expose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy.
      The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would
  allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct
  of their income support payments if flooding last year
  prevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987
  crops, Senate staff members told Reuters.
      Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National
  Commission on Dairy Policy.
      Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment
  to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting
  requirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and rice
  producers, an aide said.
      Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of
  their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their
  deficiency payments.
      Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against
  making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of
  fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to
  budget-cutting pressures.
      Representatives of these farm groups have said they also
  fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a
  bill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for
  sharply higher support prices.
      However, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sponsor of the bill, told
  Reuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor
  amendment but to bring it through the committee.

  The grain output of a major Chinese
  grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers
  lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage
  facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in
  grain, the province's vice-governor said.
      The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,
  as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as
  they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash
  crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct
  of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment
  had caused the area of irrigated land to fall.
      Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct
  of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.
      He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was
  hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a
  further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.
      He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt
  with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more
  investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use
  of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the
  tendency to rely on grain imports.
      The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to
  the National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said
  the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four
  pct from 11 pct.
      ""With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few
  years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention
  to grain and cotton production,"" he said.
      On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be
  self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the
  northeast, but it imports wheat.
      ""Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach
  the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered
  adequate,"" Tian said.

  guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, an
  EC official said.
      The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that
  the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the
  agreement.
      Under the accord, which began in January, third countries
  were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln
  tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as
  300,000 tonnes of sorghum.
      However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured that
  almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.
      The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a
  tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to
  authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.
      EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from
  outside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourable
  terms than that from the U.S.

0,"U.S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW
  U.S. corn acreage this year is 
  likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed
  acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one
  of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty
  years, Agriculture Department officials said.
      USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.
  Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will
  likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,
  down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.
      Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn
  production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987
  corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to
  around seven billion bushels.
      Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains
  program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation
  program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain
  analysts said.
      ""There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in
  corn acreage,"" one said. ""It's difficult for any farmer to not
  go along with the program this year.""
      Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but
  at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.
      Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they
  said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.
      If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the
  drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when
  farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.
      Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A
  severe drought that summer in major producing states caused
  yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2
  billion bushels.
      Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts
  said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion
  bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.
      ""This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant
  reduction in production,"" an analyst said.
      A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.
  corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not
  increase significantly, a specialist said.
      High producing corn belt states are expected to show the
  greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical
  participation in government programs, analysts said.
      In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most
  in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western
  corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.
      ""Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,""
  he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in
  higher-producing delta areas.
      Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's
  2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.
      U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in
  1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has
  steadily declined in the 1980's.
      U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in
  the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The
  highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has
  kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln
  acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.
      Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields
  averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.
      ""We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion
  bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,"" an analyst said.
      Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as
  long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts
  said.
      Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to
  set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible
  for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15
  pct of their acreage.
      ""To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to
  provide more incentives,"" an analyst said.

  The Agriculture Department's

      All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties
  which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,
  Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama
  and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity
  Operations Division for the USDA.
      USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective
  immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn
  would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,
  depending on what the differential is.
      USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted
  county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.
      ""We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a
  month, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any
  nearby time,"" Burgess said.
      Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf
  differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. ""If we're off the
  mark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the
  mark if we're too low?"" he said.
      While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,
  Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being
  planned right now.

  don't make changes often,"" he said.

  Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and
  Commerce Departments said.
      In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agency
  said mixed rain and snow covered Greece.
      Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italy
  remained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.
      Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in
  early April, it said.
      Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas
  of northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.
      Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central
  India and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas by
  late April.
      Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India,
  reversing February's below-normal trend.
      Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most
  southern areas, it said.
      In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to the
  central islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzon
  and southern Mindanao.
      Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as
  rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.
      In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding
  in Java, it said.
      The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccan
  winter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said.
      Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to
  Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in
  Southeast Asia.
      Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and
  central Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet
  crop demands, it said.
      Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintained
  adequate moisture for crop growth, it said.
      Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks as
  winter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase,

  The European Community Commission has
  decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne
  imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.
      They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and
  non-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports
  from Spanish ports south of Valencia.
      The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's
  cereals management committee today.
      The tax had been introduced last September at the same time
  as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports
  of maize to Spain from other EC member countries.
      The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into
  Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from
  being reexported back to them.
      The sources added that Spain had received no answer from
  the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the
  sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.
      The request will be considered at the committee's next
  meeting, the commission sources said.
      Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of
  maize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC
  producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000
  tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

      The deadline for a final determination is March 7.

      Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn

  month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to

0,"NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING
  A greater than anticipated need,
  competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking
  Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials
  said.
      As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the
  Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.
  corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors
  that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.
      First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said
  recent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop
  be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln
  announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.
      A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect
  Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.
      Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the
  USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its
  Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln
  tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also
  cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.
      Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this
  year's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln
  tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.
      ""Significant downside potential"" still exists for the
  Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the
  amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.
      ""If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been
  thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can
  provide during the April to June period,"" he said.
      Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked
  Soviet buying.
      U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market
  earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn
  for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet
  sources said.
      ""This price difference makes American corn competitive,""
  Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,
  told Reuters.
      Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause
  those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn
  futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have
  bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.
      Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the
  minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains
  agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to
  convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.
      In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary
  Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat
  subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.

1,"HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS
  The 1988 agriculture budget will
  have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the
  chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.
      Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the
  use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are
  possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,
  said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture
  subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.
      Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and
  Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the
  House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have
  to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion
  dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.
      Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be
  made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988
  budget, Glickman added.
      Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's 
  proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.
      ""The administration's target price proposals are dead in
  the water,"" he said.
      To cut the budget, Glickman said, ""everthing is on the
  table,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.
      Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee
  will study in order to cut farm spending.
      Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and
  1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he
  said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.
      Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or ""pik')
  certificates will also be another option his committee will
  study, Glickman said.
      While not committing himself for or against such action, he
  said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which
  indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.
      Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and
  tightening up of the person definition for annual payment
  limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.
      He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by
  five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move
  that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would
  not be in favor of such a change.
      Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,
  EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being
  used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand
  this program while making cuts in other areas.
      Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.
      ""I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping
  block,"" Glickman said.

1,"WINTER WEATHER HURTS EAST GERMAN GRAIN - USDA
  Shifts from mild to very cold
  weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown
  winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the
  U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.
      In a field report, the officer said indications were that
  winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared
  with 38,000 last year.
      He said the damage was probably more limited in southern
  and central regions and most widespread in the north.
      Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where
  little or no snow cover was present, he added.
      The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine
  during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well
  developed plants and for winter barley.
      Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing
  water occurred in the fields.
      The officer said repairing damage will probably call for
  special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and
  where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed
  applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.

1,"INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW
  Indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow
  by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
  in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
  declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
      Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to
  fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
  26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
  Indonesia""s agricultural performance.
      The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
  26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
  1987.
      The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
  tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
  a drawdown on stocks.
      ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
  promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
  production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
  gain,"" the report says.
      ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
  to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
  and palm kernels.""
      Constraints to significant overall increases in
  agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
  seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
  farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
  report underlines.
      The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
  pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
  largely offset gains in yields.
      The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
  insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
  resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
  resistant rice types.
      The government is depending on increased production of
  export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
  palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
  oil prices.
      Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
  in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
  to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
  report says.
      But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
  rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
  also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
      The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
  meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
  September""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
  in domestic demand.
      The report said that Indonesia""s overall economic
  performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
  negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
  mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
  in 1984.
      The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
  for the slump.

1,"U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION
  Advocates of a 0/92 plan for
  feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a
  disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is
  scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional
  sources said.
      The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English
  (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to
  implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.
      An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987
  wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that
  scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.
      Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,
  it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should
  be treated equally, they said.
     If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then
  supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not
  offer their proposals next week, sources said.
     English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles
  Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but
  whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.
      Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first
  choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat
  farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid
  for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of
  controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an
  even greater cutback in the bill, they said.
      Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still
  receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
      Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)
  have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to
  include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.
      An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm
  bill, but to be fair to all crops.
      Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would
  likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are
  greater than to idle the land, economists said.
      Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is
  premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the
  House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the
  impacts of such a program.

  The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB)

      ""We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export
  target for the year,"" he said in a statement.
      He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB
  spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the
  Soviet Union and Iraq.
      In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB
  exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.
      Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has
  ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered
  to the AWB.
      The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of
  receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.
      However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was
  still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat
  may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final
  Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.
      Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February

      But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could
  turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the

0,"ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL
  Argentine grain growers reduced
  their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current
  harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
      Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach
  between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes
  estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in
  mid-February.
      But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7
  pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according
  to official figures, and would be a new record.
      The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a
  record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct
  compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.
      The change in yield estimates is due to very high
  temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in
  the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and
  northern Buenos Aires province.
      The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean
  pods empty, especially in Cordoba.
      Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since
  rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.
      Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in
  Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There
  was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.
      With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were
  able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent
  weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,
  sunflower and sorghum harvesting.
      Crops were considered in generally good condition, though
  it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of
  recent weeks caused any long-term damage.
      The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the
  total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.
      Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at
  3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85
  mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.
      Total production for the current maize harvest is expected
  to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln
  tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct
  lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,
  according to official figures.
      The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of
  total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.
      Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two
  to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record
  3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
      The current harvest's volume was again expected to be
  between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than
  last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.
      Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared
  that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on
  crops and, consequently, on total production volume.
      The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of
  total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.
      Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and
  1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln
  hectares planted in the previous harvest.
      Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest

  Rain over wide areas has raised the
  prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffered
  a disastrous drought and famine two years ago.
      Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's Agriculture
  Development Department, told reporters prospects were good for
  attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present
  growing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.
      Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes
  a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the ""belg""
  (small) rains which fall at this time of year.
      The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like
  maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects
  production in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their
  stocks of seed.
      Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions
  which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow
  their crops because of the favourable rains.
      The government had distributed large quantities of seed and
  fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.

  organization, told Reuters he had no information to
  substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but
  said that Moscow ""would consider"" buying U.S. wheat if it was

      ""We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are

1,"CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES
  The Canadian Wheat Board has advised
  the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to
  farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year
  beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.
      The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended
  price drops but said it would not be good news for western
  Canadian grain growers.
      ""They're all lower,"" he said. ""This is really getting
  pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival
  and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.""
      Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will
  recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
      Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is
  delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.
      If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,
  obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the
  farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If
  prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
      The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in
  April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the
  federal cabinet.
      Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27
  pct but last fall the government announced a one billion
  Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.
      But federal agricultural officials have already warned
  farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

  Australian wheat plantings are
  forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72
  mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF)
  said in its first preliminary crop forecast.
      But there was no reason to expect Australian production in
  1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year,
  the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and
  Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.
      Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western
  Australia while state average yields would be assisted by
  growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.
      The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a
  poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But
  in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided
  that rainfall between now and June is not less than average,
  AWF said.
      Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back
  wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they
  needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative
  crops.
      ""The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and
  oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a
  high proportion of growers' income,"" AWF said.

1,"HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT
  Key members of the House Agriculture
  committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a
  pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a
  broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later,
  Congressional sources said.
      The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn
  English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support
  an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm
  (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop
  winter and spring wheat.
      This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original
  proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987
  wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the
  subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.
      Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still
  collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.
      Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed
  until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill
  and 0/92.
      The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program
  follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential
  farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,
  and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.
      Congressional sources said there has not been enough time
  to study the implications of a broad 0/92.
      ""The timing (of the proposal) is off,"" said one aide to a
  House Agriculture committee member.
      However, several Congressional sources said they expect a
  broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House
  Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make
  spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part
  of an overall deficit reduction package.
      Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley
  (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may
  exceed one billion dlrs.
      A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the
  Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration
  estimate it would result in significant budget savings.
      A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all
  1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5
  billion dlrs over five years.
      Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the
  approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.
      Some officials said it already is late for implementation
  of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for
  wheat and feedgrains.
      If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either
  would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.

1,"GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN
  Implementation of a one-year 0/92
  pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted
  today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee
  as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers
  another option when making their planting decisions.
      ""We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,
  but we are locked into this,"" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),
  chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed
  grains. ""We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the
  farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.""
      Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill
  for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman
  said that it will probably be introduced next week.
      Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to
  forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency
  payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --
  only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under
  the current bill.
      It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,
  he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet
  budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than
  sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.
      A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a
  different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.
      Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government
  payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this
  point, he said.
      ""I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a
  decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,"" Glickman said
  at the hearing.
      Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the
  Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term
  0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.
      Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His
  plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to
  participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to
  conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra
  idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres
  in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.
      ""I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but
  we can at least move in that direction,"" Boschwitz said.
      Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified
  in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias
  in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'
  dependency on the government, he said.
      A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson
  said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.
      Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and
  the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose
  any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the
  farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.
      But when asked if his association were forced to choose
  between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry
  Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92
  rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

  U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary
  Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demand
  situation has become more bullish recently because of
  developments in the world market and increased consumption.
      Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations
  subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved
  the wheat outlook.
      He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about
  20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also
  reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings
  have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of
  greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.
      ""It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption
  to be in far better balance than a year ago,"" Amstutz said.
  

"
1,"IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED
  Efforts by governments to control wheat
  surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial
  success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its
  latest monthly report.
      Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing
  both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC
  says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat
  exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.
      In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,
  which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export
  income, there may be problems in reducing production.
      A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to
  unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.
  Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then
  lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.
      The IWC outlines three courses of action open to
  governments in wheat exporting countries.
      They could continue to support prices in the hope that when
  the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and
  surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.
      Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which
  could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long
  period.
      This option may prove to be the most politically
  unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning
  wheat production, the report said.
      The third option would be for governments to distinguish
  between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,
  possibly varying support prices according to farm size or
  overall production.
      The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting
  countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the
  producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.
      These changes did not always result in lower export
  subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more
  than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.
      For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention
  price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European
  currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which
  most export transactions are denominated, the intervention
  price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of
  supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers
  and some governments are now searching for ways to cut
  expenditure, the report says.
      The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five
  major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey
  from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to
  increased production in China and India.
      The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was
  countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower
  acreages.
      In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per
  cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to
  other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.
  Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

1,"EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA
  The European Community, EC, sold
  75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85
  and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing
  bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per
  tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest
  report on Export Markets for U.S grains.
      EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during
  1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in
  the 1985/86 season, it said.
      The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a
  time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat
  import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current
  forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.
      The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in
  domestic production, and says government plans to lower the
  guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs
  will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.
      It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of
  the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of
  U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only
  600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

1,"USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT
  The Soviet Union will likely honor
  its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four
  mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department
  official said.
      ""They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no
  reason now to think they won't this year,"" he told Reuters.
      ""They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European
  Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers
  from all sources at this point,"" the official said in
  explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports
  estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.
      This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when
  analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for
  the first time in 15 years.
      A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern
  over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.
  corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's
  recent interest.
      Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying
  countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,
  and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the
  official said.
      ""The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists""
  and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. ""As
  soon as they need corn, they'll buy it,"" he added.
      USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the
  Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the
  purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.
      The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets
  would enter the U.S. market again.
      ""There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the
  situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of
  frenetic buying now,"" the official said.
      However, the situation in wheat is ""a different story,"" he
  said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase
  commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet
  purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.
      Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.
  is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to
  the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.

      The ruling is the result of trade action launched in 1985

1,"AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS
  Australia is risking wheat export
  sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet
  buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.
      ""Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality
  conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality
  specifications,"" the board said in a submission to the Royal
  Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.
      ""Many of the specifications are more specific than the
  current categories used in Australia,"" it said.
      The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs
  and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.
      Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market
  share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but
  lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.
      It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every
  stage from receival to shipping.
      Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more
  uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock
  control were vital to improved marketing, it said.
      The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded
  the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of
  wheat.
      The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative
  constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient
  transport of grains to other states for shipment.
      ""It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode
  to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in
  which the wheat is grown or stored,"" it said.
      For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)
  might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to
  Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,
  southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or
  Geelong, in Victoria.
      Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over
  grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.
      The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk
  handling authorities is not essential, although it said it
  favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current
  level of control of storage and transport as long as quality
  was maintained.
      An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between
  26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at
  various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston
  and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department has
  accepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into
  the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.
      In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted
  bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.
      The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to
  90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.
      Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be
  ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with
  permanent vegetative cover.
      Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in
  the conservation program to take advantage of a corn ""bonus""
  rental payment that was offered by USDA.
      The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity
  certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS
  program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based
  accepted into the reserve.
      The state showing the biggest enrollment in the
  conservation program during this signup was Texas with
  approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln
  acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and
  Kansas with 842,000 acres.
      Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with
  646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraska
  with 554,000 acres.
      In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana, 217,000
  acres and 116,000 acres respectively were enrolled.
      Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program
  totals 19,488,587 acres. Bids on the previous signups ranged up
  to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 45.52 dlrs.
  

"
1,"U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES
  From April through December 1986,
  the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs
  worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not
  been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in
  certificates has been authorized for issuance during
  January-August, 1987.
      These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn
  and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department
  said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.
      Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain
  more competitive on world markets, it said.
      The department said last summer, for example, certificates
  were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped
  increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices
  averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they
  would have otherwise.
      The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40
  to 50 mln bushels, it said.
      The department said government spending on farm programs in
  fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from
  1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.
      During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half
  of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,
  annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last
  year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.
      The department said the President's budget proposals for
  1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24
  billion dlrs.
      In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain
  close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct
  average of 1980-86, it said.
      Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume
  is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven
  years, the department said.

1,"WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT
  Unfavorable late winter weather
  conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia
  indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,
  the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.
      The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to
  Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop
  had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell
  that followed a period of warm weather.
      He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that
  brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was
  followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.
      Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which
  show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf
  and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.
      The report said that since much of the early growth in
  February was from late seeding rather than from normal
  development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive
  than some local observers say.
      The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields
  on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and
  chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.
      However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable
  and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which
  would aid recovery.

  with purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported
  under the daily reporting system). Other large increaes were
  posted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said.
      Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and
  170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said.
      Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and

      Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were
  two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the
  marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser.
      Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of
  4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than
  offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama,
  the department said.
      Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for
  the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season --
  were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the

  would not discuss making U.S. wheat prices ""cheap.""
      ""There sometimes is a difference between being competitive

  Appropriations hearing.
      Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and
  Washington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offered
  on wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheat
  price was competitive or cheap.
      ""I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore this

  willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow ""if the issue is
  being cheap.""
      Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction
  between competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate.
      Amstutz said it is the U.S. judgment that the long-term
  grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to
  buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at

  Heavy rains fell again in
  Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday,
  trade sources said.
      Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly
  high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and
  Santa Fe provinces.
      Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires,
  heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La
  Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.
  Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.
      Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to
  31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm
  in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in
  Chaco.
      Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the
  rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower
  crops may have suffered.
      Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by
  the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains
  would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow
  farm machinery to operate.
      The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern
  Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas
  there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.
      Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,
  Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after
  flying over the flooded area.
      Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000
  hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that
  200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large
  parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are
  low-lying and flood easily.
      Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the
  heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of
  the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high
  winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.
      The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south
  of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated
  areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between
  15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct
  a week ago.
      Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were
  revised downward in light of the bad weather.
      Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,
  down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down
  34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15
  pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week
  ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2
  mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a
  week ago.
      Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes,
  according to official figures.
      Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8
  to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln
  tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln
  tonnes, according to official figures.
      Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between
  four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four
  pct a week ago.
      Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5
  mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes

  Grain traders and analysts look for a

      The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the
  acres submitted, they said.
      Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is
  only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year
  has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.
      However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may
  end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade
  talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted
  by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation
  program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total
  corn production will be minimal, they added.

1,"USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT
  The Soviet Union will likely honor
  its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four
  mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department
  official said.
      ""They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no
  reason now to think they won't this year,"" he told Reuters.
      ""They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European
  Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers
  from all sources at this point,"" the official said in
  explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports
  estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.
      This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when
  analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for
  the first time in 15 years.
      A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern
  over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.
  corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's
  recent interest.
      Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying
  countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,
  and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the
  official said.
      ""The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists""
  and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. ""As
  soon as they need corn, they'll buy it,"" he added.
      USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the
  Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the
  purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.
      The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets
  would enter the U.S. market again.
      ""There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the
  situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of
  frenetic buying now,"" the official said.
      However, the situation in wheat is ""a different story,"" he
  said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase
  commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet
  purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.
      Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.
  is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to
  the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.

      In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency
  said southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetative

  Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the
  south.
       Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui,
  eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversed
  February's below normal precipitation pattern.
      The agency said the wet weather in these areas provided
  ample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need for
  irrigation. 
      Mostly dry weather in early-rice areas of Guanxi and
  Guandong resulted in irrigation for continued rice planting, it

0,"GRAIN REPORTS IMPROVE U.S. FARM OUTLOOK-ANALYSTS
  The U.S. grain planting intentions and
  stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a
  grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.
      The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks
  are ""the first report we've had for a long time that shows any
  optimism for anybody,"" said John ""Bud"" Frazier, grain analyst
  and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.
      ""I'm really excited about it,"" Frazier said.
      The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to
  plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last
  year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.
      The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of
  soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels
  of wheat, all below trade guesses.
      Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst
  with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with
  Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade
  panel to discuss the reports.
      Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly
  for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five
  cents a bushel ""if the bell rang right now.""
      ""We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and
  soybeans) than we thought we had,"" he said, noting that hog and
  poultry production is up.
      ""We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,""
  said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and
  15 pct in the preceding quarter.
      However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed
  consumption.
      She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came
  in southeastern states, where yields are usually low.
      ""We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields
  this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's
  opening,"" she said.
      Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the
  crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from
  last year's 8.25 billion bushels.
      ""We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce
  stocks,"" she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year
  at 6.7 billion bushels.
      Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long
  term, ""But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down
  to where we could start rebuilding prices.""
      Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report
  could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more
  soybeans.
      The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage
  talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.
      ""There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law
  we're working under today, and this report should reinforce
  that,"" Frazier said.
      ""We are seeing the program beginning to work,"" said Meyer.

  Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries
  for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the
  country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.
      Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid
  needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.
      The letter said the government had to step in ""to avert
  serious economic hardship"" and because the Social Services
  Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision
  of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.
      The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six
  month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop
  was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and
  other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of
  sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.
      In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha
  (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completely
  devastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now
  estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally
  expected.
      There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high
  forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate
  rainfall within the next three to four weeks.
      ""Should the present drought continue, however, production is
  estimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added.
      Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90
  and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last
  year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.
      The letter said villagers in most seriously affected
  districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because
  subsidiary crops had also failed.
      It said the government's current budget did not permit it
  to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.
  ""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity
  prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue
  to exert pressure on the expenditure side.""
      The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per
  month for each family, as well as handling, transport and
  distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by
  the government would not be possible without seriously
  impairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation""
  in the economy, the letter said.
      The letter said the Food Department would be able to
  release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the
  immediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replaced
  subsequently.""
      The Meteorological Department said the country was
  experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month
  dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when
  the monsoon rains fell in late May.
      The letter said some areas had been experiencing the
  drought since August, and in the rice growing district of
  Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June
  1986.

  Missouri Republican Senators John

  92 pct of their deficiency payments this year without planting.

  provision included in a House Agriculture Committee-passed
  emergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up by
  the House tomorrow.
      Schlick said flooding destroyed a number of levees along
  the two rivers last October, leaving farmland there vulnerable

1,"HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE
  A House Agriculture Committee meeting
  later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a
  debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or
  ""de-coupling,"" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who
  oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources
  said.
      The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year
  0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter
  wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and
  still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
      The administration has strongly urged that the bill be
  expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.
      It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision
  will emerge from the committee, the sources said.
      Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large
  estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates
  by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.
      Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this
  time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of
  the bill, committee staffers said.
      The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A
  conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and
  staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.
      Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an
  expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of
  the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup
  for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.
      Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so
  something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be
  implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.
      An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last
  week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee
  chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the
  consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was
  necessary.
      Major commodity groups, including the National Corn
  Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's
  Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.
      But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill
  currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it
  should be extended to other crops.
      There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said
  Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.
      Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to
  decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the
  debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.
      Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce
  a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the
  argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major
  changes in the farm bill.
      ""Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the
  timing,"" a congressional staff member said.
      Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an
  amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988
  feedgrains.

  intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers
  of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92
  pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they
  planted.
      Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that
  applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was
  supported by the Reagan administration and would save
  approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn
  payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.
      The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the
  Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of
  Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House
  Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.
      Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.
  Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency
  payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not
  to plant under the decoupling scheme.
      If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market
  prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished
  deficiency payments.
      Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
  said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as
  possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter
  further before deciding how he would vote on it.

1,"U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT
  A statement yesterday by Secretary
  of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
  U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was
  significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
  market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market
  levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.
      They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly
  endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy
  because they were not negative towards such action.
      In response to a query on what the State Department's
  position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told
  the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
  prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.
      The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has
  bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the
  price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall
  to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export
  enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.
      Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat
  offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
  obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
  Union, grain industry sources said.
      Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat
  offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
  recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
  another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,
  while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.
      ""I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a
  recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the
  Soviet Union,"" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.
      ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
  somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
  thing at a lower price somewhere else,"" Shultz told the farm
  leaders. ""That is our approach in negotiations with the
  Soviets,"" he said.
      If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
  longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,
  it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
  Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.
      National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious
  attitude towards the secretary's comments.
      ""His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our
  judgment promise any immediate action on EEP,"" an official with
  the wheat group said.
      The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that ""there is
  significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant
  negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.""
      In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of
  Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
  that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the
  officials said.
      An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is
  reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,
  said that the Shultz comments ""are consistent with what he
  (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,"" but said they
  don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.
      Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to
  Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.
      But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
  indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.
      ""If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is
  potentially a positive development,"" a commodity source said.

"
1,"CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS
  Chicago Board of trade grain traders and
  analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
  handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
  crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
  in the futures markets.
      Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
  be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
  corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives
  deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
      Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
  sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
      With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
  traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
  rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
  soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
  attractive under normal circumstances.
      An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the
  limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
  means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
  more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
  traders said.
      Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
  shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
  more attractive deal from the government, they added.
      Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
  months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to
  put soybean land back into cotton.
      One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
  production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
  traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,
  which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

"
1,"AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92
  A 0/92 program would have very
  little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only
  an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according
  to a report from the Agriculture Department.
      The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres
  idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35
  mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln
  dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.
      The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92
  acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.
  Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.
      ""The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very
  large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite
  small,"" the report said.
      ""The returns on typical farms still favor participation in
  the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted
  acreage,"" the USDA report said.
      The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego
  planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,
  would be most used by producers in high production/high risk
  areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,
  director of USDA's economics analysis staff.
      ""In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much
  participation,"" Collins said.
      USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat
  would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000
  acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.
      Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40
  mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels
  of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of
  cotton, the report said.
      ""In determining whether to participate, a producer would
  need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the
  loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the
  expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be
  considered,"" according to the analysis.
      ""What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between
  the loan rate and the cost of production,"" Collins said.
      For producers with low production costs, that difference is
  greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.
  Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along
  with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more
  attractive.
      Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be
  more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.
      ""I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at
  first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating
  production decisions from government payments,"" Collins said.
      In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and
  Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too
  late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will
  be over by the end of this month.

0,"U.S. SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF-DESTRUCT, CONGRESSMAN
  A leading U.S. farm-state
  Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next
  year for legislation to control domestic production of
  sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry
  fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.
      ""We're moving toward a direction where we could
  self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program),"" Rep. Huckaby, chairman
  of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar
  issues, told Reuters in an interview.
      Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year
  they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the
  same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also
  said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.
      Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic
  sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further
  cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.
      ""I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)
  another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point
  where the program might not work,"" he said.
      ""Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,""
  said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.
      A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the
  current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the
  U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports
  holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.
      A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made
  until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.
      ""I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could
  probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through
  the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),""
  Huckaby said.
      However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup
  producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener
  market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.
      He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will
  capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in
  the U.S.
      But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the
  production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further
  expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports
  might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.
      Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner
  companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.
      ""This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have
  some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the
  program is preserved,"" Huckaby said.
      Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to
  think about how domestic output could be controlled, either
  through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.
      Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the
  Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask
  corn refiners to limit production.
      ""I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do
  there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do
  that legally?"" he said.
      Asked if he would proceed with production controls without
  the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said ""You build a fragile
  house if you do it that way.""
      Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers
  have expanded production, because high sugar price support
  means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such
  as soybeans and grain.
      But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would
  not be good policy.
      Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to

1,"EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND
  The European Commission's decision to
  release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention
  feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate
  relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.
      Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,
  pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the
  market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes
  were granted.
      The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to
  satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for
  supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.
      The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong
  representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.
  There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,
  triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in
  interior markets.
      The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the
  April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.
  The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and
  June.
      News of the release produced an early downward reaction in
  local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved
  early two stg losses while others were unchanged.
      Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln
  tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the
  free market. However, some traders believe these figures are
  overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the
  bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off
  the market in futures stores.
      A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been
  sold for export or to the home market since the season started
  July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59
  mln tonnes.
      Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln
  tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.
      This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all
  early expectations and has created the present nervous
  situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market
  supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in
  August.
      The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total
  barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new
  record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes
  achieved in the 1984/85 season.
      Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and
  barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.
      The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln
  tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28
  mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders
  said.
      Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British
  grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln
  tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares
  with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.
      The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay
  buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies
  become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed
  compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said.

  would not discuss making U.S. wheat prices ""cheap.""
      ""There sometimes is a difference between being competitive
  and being cheap,"" Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture
  Appropriations hearing.
      Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and
  Washington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offered
  on wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheat
  price was competitive or cheap.
      ""I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore this
  issue as it pertains to competitiveness,"" Amstutz said.
      However, Amstutz added that the United States would not be
  willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow ""if the issue is
  being cheap.""
      Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction
  between competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate.
      Amstutz said it is the U.S. judgment that the long-term
  grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to
  buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at
  ""prices in effect in this country.""

  U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert
  Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the
  so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.
      Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he
  thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration,
  ""should be seriously considered"" because a refusal to do so could
  ""play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls"" placed
  on production.
      However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92
  option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their
  income support payments regardless of how much they planted.
      The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two
  problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In
  addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm
  bill, Dole said.
      Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export
  enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union
  could help improve U.S. relations with that country.
      Dole said that the United States has made the decision to
  trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive
  prices.
      The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this
  year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy
  program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets
  lost to other suppliers which subsidize.
      Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require
  a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called
  for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.
      The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes
  ""are not going anywhere"" this year, Dole said, singling out the
  proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.
      Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a
  shift in the State Department towards supporting an export
  enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he
  didn't see any change.
      Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate
  whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.

  David Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.)

"
1,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.
      In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy
  Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct
  sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.
      ""We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,""
  he added.
      Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign
  currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to
  buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in
  exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.
      But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some
  inherent problems, they added.
      ""It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that
  the trade should always be balanced,"" one trade source said. ""The
  other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy
  commodities which the other party wants.""
      Another added, ""Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it
  as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of
  payments difficulty.
      ""This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.
  It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy.""

  it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.
      By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA
  could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,
  where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the
  government price support loan program and then marketed.
      If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement
  would break the Gulf corn basis.
      ""The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county
  posted prices,"" one dealer said. ""It should be taking the
  average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,"" which
  would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior
  Midwest.
      ""But we don't know when they might do it,"" an Ohio dealer
  said, which has created uncertainty in the market.
      The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort
  to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to
  the government and remain off the market and in storage.
      Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly
  more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates
  it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date
  been exchanged for grain.
      With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK
  certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the
  USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain
  by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.
      A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in
  barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest
  to the export terminals, cash dealers said.
      Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen
  nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the
  original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of
  the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the
  firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.
      The higher transportation costs have served to depress
  interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by
  the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as
  discouraging farmer marketings, they said.
      ""The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,""
  which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much
  as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader
  said.
      But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,
  freight rates will settle back down because of the overall
  surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.

0,"U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS
  Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.
  corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
  deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
  and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
  sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
      Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
  the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
  budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
      Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
  payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
  mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
      The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
  per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
  received by producers requesting advance payments.
      Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
  between an established target price and the higher of the basic
  loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
  during the first five months of the marketing year --
  September-January.
      National weighted average market prices for the first five
  months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
  1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
  be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
  3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
      Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
  per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
  bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
  rate.
      The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
  maximum permitted by law, the department said.
      Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
  1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
  market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
  year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
  department said.
      The payments will be issued through local Agricultural
  Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

1,"MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE
  Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill
  its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement
  depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official
  told Reuters.
      ""How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement
  if the United States does not want to offer us grain at
  competitive prices?"" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
  representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.
      ""We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the
  United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive
  prices,"" he said in an interview.
      Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the
  agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at
  prevailing market prices.
      ""We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.
  We do not consider we are at fault,"" Melnikov said.
      Article I in the agreement states that ""purchases/sales of
  commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market
  price prevailing for these products at the time of
  purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.""
      ""The United States should supply to the Soviet Union
  definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the
  United States ready to supply this?"" he said.
      The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has
  been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he
  confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices
  remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.
      Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.
      ""If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,
  then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the
  United States to decide how these competitive prices will be
  offered,"" he said.
      Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets
  was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.
  He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,
  U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

  Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.
      He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
  end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
  were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.
      Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
  larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
  opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
  intervention.
      A small amount of French barley has already been put into
  intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.
      The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports

  tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in

      Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints about
  the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC
  membership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and
  300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.
      All this produce will be imported into Spain at special
  levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into
  other EC countries.
      The sources said it was possible that the Spanish
  intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly
  this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.
      They added that the choice for future years appears to lie
  between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily
  special levy applicable to Spanish imports.
      There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and
  sorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a tax
  could be imposed later, the sources added.

1,"U.S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER
  The U.S. House Agriculture Committee
  approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement
  Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan
  administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.
      The proposals were approved as amendments to a
  comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.
      In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee
  approved several proposals which could restrict imports of
  lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those
  amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because
  the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall
  jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,
  Congressional sources said.
      The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the
  life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than
  the current three years through fiscal 1988.
      The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also
  would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from
  1.5 billion now.
      Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by
  Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department
  to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition
  value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct
  less expensive to operate.
      The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by
  Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration
  make an offer, but urges such action.
      The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn
  English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to
  begin discussions with other major grain producing countries
  aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.
      Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the
  amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.
      Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved
  by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on
  imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm
  product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered
  by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at
  curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and
  foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect
  peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.
      Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of
  casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New
  Zealand and Ireland.
      The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same
  countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.
  beef imports.
      Other miscellaneous amendments included:
      -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against
  Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove
  restrictions on beef imports.
      -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped
  each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to
  800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.
      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of
  the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to
  determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.
      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the
  National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the
  costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a
  Canadian countervailing duty case this year.
      -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision
  to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the
  European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.
      -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National
  Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a

1,"IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD
  The International Wheat Council (IWC)
  lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain
  production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared
  with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.
      In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving
  unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming
  1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a
  record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in
  1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.
  The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to
  87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.
      The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and
  coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln
  against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln
  rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.
      The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is
  likely to be down from last year as low world prices and
  restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.
      At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a
  drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There
  is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the
  IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.
      Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain
  outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the
  European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is
  expected lower but oat sowings could rise.
      After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union
  plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln
  hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are
  likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved
  weather and a further increase in the use of intensive
  cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet
  maize output in 1987, the IWC said.
      Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be
  bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC
  said.
      It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at
  endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln
  tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.
      After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln
  tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of
  another large crop this coming season with higher output
  expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

  A Portuguese court has made a
  preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC
  should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders
  open to private importers, grain traders and officials said.
      Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the
  European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC
  (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced
  by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.
      Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being
  permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first
  liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs.
  The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal
  proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.
      Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil
  court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be
  allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.
      Trade sources said the ruling, though effective
  immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be
  confirmed in further proceedings.
      A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said
  that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would
  not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being
  held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.
      Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's
  participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of
  Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual
  dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.
      It also said the participation of EPAC, which still
  controls the national grain storage and distribution network,
  was unfair competition to the private traders.
      Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission
  was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to
  leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.
      ""They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile,"" one
  trader said.
      ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if
  necessary.

0,"FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS
  The Agriculture Department will have
  to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind
  certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA
  decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain
  deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.
      Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to
  feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for
  the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50
  cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they
  want to do the same for feedgrains.
      Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn
  deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42
  billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment
  must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.
      However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of
  deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,
  doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.
      Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation
  from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge
  release of certs onto the market.
      Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final
  feedgrain deficiency payment to ""as soon as five months after
  harvest as possible,"" rather than the current year lag time.
      Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole
  (R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation
  forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.

  The Sichuan government has ordered that
  any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against
  drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and
  manpower, the People's Daily domestic edition said.
      Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought.
      Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worst
  for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in
  100 counties in Sichuan, the country's biggest agricultural
  producer.
      Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees
  Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less
  than normal since early February, affecting wheat, oil-bearing
  crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said.
      The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county in
  Guangdong are seriously short of water.
      The People's Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are
  also suffering from drought.
      Henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from
  the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the
  province since May.

1,"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET
  Consuming countries, chastened by the
  collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support
  operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that
  commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are
  serving, a Reuter survey showed.
      They want price ranges to be more responsive to market
  trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the
  accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid
  the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.
  Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,
  have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.
      Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a
  generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and
  prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey
  showed.
      The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set
  precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do
  under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase
  limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets
  and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of
  total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This
  will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the
  world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.
      The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer
  Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.
      A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was
  adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting
  countries agreed several changes to make the reference price
  more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions
  under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance
  operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund
  buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature
  of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running
  into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.
      Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations
  in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that
  agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.
      Consumers and a small group of producers argued that
  ""objective criteria"" should be used to define export quota
  shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of
  Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain
  its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,
  although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,
  delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term
  negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.
      International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These
  do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for
  discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect
  statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said
  differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any
  progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer
  competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut
  militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.
      An alternative focus for commodity discussions are
  international study groups, made up of governments with advice
  from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.
      The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned
  directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to
  become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet
  Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the
  U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,
  citing the lack of widespread support.
      U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in
  Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity
  pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to
  study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented
  commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.
      ""We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the
  price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,""
  official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently
  belongs to only two international commodity agreements that
  have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement
  (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat
  pacts.
      The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement
  because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and
  not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,
  the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA
  as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.
      U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members
  of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment
  mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect
  market trends and also to continue the accord as a market
  oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.
      Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have
  consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on
  the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister
  Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the
  world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its
  participation in international commodity pacts case by case.
      Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing
  Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC
  launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes
  for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from
  70,000.
      Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and
  delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told
  Reuters in London, ""Agreements with economic clauses to
  stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were
  close to market reality, if there was full participation by
  producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to
  take their obligations in the framework of the agreement
  seriously.""
      But Baron added, ""No real sanctions are available for a
  country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German
  approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best
  instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant
  to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how
  developing countries often interpret them.""
      Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of
  commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third
  World producing countries. But recently demands for more
  stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the
  need for ""intellectual honesty"" and ""objective criteria"" have
  grown.
      British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be
  a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.
      It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct
  market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree
  of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended
  borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.
  Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to
  reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather
  than dictate what prices should be.
      A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price
  realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.
      A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable
  to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of
  sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real
  market situation, particularly regarding stocks.
      Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told
  Reuters in Jakarta: ""These agreements can work as long as the
  problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are
  structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity
  agreements as an act of faith."" Nicaraguan External Trade
  Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers
  cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity
  agreements.
      ""The political will is not there on the part of some
  consumers to make agreements work,"" Martinez Cuenca said.
      The head of the economics department in the Brazilian
  Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an
  agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market
  reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system
  of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact
  and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham
  Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings
  enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean
  greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.
  

"
1,"SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER
  Speculation the United States will
  offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
  reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
  State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
      Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
  markets since officials from the two countries held their
  customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
  decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
  strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
      Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
      Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
  the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
  Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
  Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
  here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
  preparing an offer.
      Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
  Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
  about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
      But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
  contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
  while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility.
      Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
  asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
  offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
      Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
  are saying they would not rule one out.
      Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
  predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
  to two weeks.
      Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
  who had been in contact with administration officials.
      Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
  Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
  offer would be made by the middle of this month.
      Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
  up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
  year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
  per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
      Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
  subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
  U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
      As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
  would appear to be price.
      Last summer the administration took the controversial step
  of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
  embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
  that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
  far above world market prices.
      The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
  front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
  means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
  criticism, grain trade sources said.
      Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
  from saying the Soviets were ""chortling"" because Washington was
  offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
  U.S. housewives.
      The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
  here is that a general warming of relations between the two
  countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
  in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
      In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
  buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
      However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
  surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
  subsidy offer last summer.
      Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
  industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
  decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
  only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
      Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
  include only the Soviets.
      That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
  uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
  that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
  sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

  activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money.
      The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in
  Bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations
  designed to stop price increases, the officials said.
      Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the
  past month, market sources said. But the government expects
  prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month.
  

"
0,"U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA
  The U.S. Agriculture Department 
  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to
  drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers
  for the cut with targeted income payments.
      In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying
  the ""Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987"", Peter Myers,
  Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration
  wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning
  with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.
      Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the
  government for the price support cut with targeted income
  payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would
  cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.
      The administration sugar proposal is expected to be
  introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.
  John Porter, R-Ill.
      Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it
  is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because
  politically-influential sugar and corn growers
  and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.
      The direct payment plan outlined by the administration 
  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually
  lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment
  any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.
      For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower
  would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3
  cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.
      The income payments would be based on the amount of
  commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985
  or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.
      Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes
  in the sugar program because the current high price support is
  causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.
      He said the current program has artificially stimulated
  domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed
  corn sweeteners to make market inroads.
      U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a
  ""progressive contraction"" of the sugar import quota to only one
  mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar
  refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.
      Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives
  overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a
  competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of
  sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing
  facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.
      USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on
  U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said
  consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than
  necessary for sugar.
      ""Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between
  sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse
  impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently
  facing,"" Myers said.
      The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per
  lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons
  recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to
  compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

1,"U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM
  The House of Representatives
  approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains
  farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at
  least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if
  they did not plant.
      The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers
  in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed
  by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.
      Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92
  provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.
      USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying
  crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed
  broad-scale revision of farm programs.
      The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from
  planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the
  deficiency payments they would have received.
      To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a
  different crop on that land this spring, although they could
  use the land for grazing or to plant hay.
      USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,
  largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.
      The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers
  along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented
  from planting crops this year because of residual damage from
  last fall's flooding.
      In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full
  payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved
  by Congress last fall.
      Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs
  in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the
  region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.
      The administration said it opposed the bill because, by
  expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart
  efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an
  alternative to federal disaster assistance.
      USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were
  narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option
  to all major commodities and would produce insignificant
  savings.
      USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers
  would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the
  requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would
  cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by
  Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln
  dlrs.
      USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln
  dlrs.
      In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987
  winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.
      But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to
  wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling
  on the disaster assistance program.

1,"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA
  The Australian Government will likely
  reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
  dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
  department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
  reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
  insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
  around 98 dlrs per tonne.
       For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
  mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
  breakeven export price, it said.
      Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
  payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
  at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
  year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
  department said.
      In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
  storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
      But the department said the Australian Bureau of
  Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
  drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
  1989/90.
      The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
  to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
  wheat exports, the department said.

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard

  agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.
      ""It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....They
  haven't lived up to the agreement as I see it,"" Lyng said in an
  interview with Reuters.
      ""It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to
  work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to
  be a one-sided thing,"" he said.
      However, Lyng said he did not want to make a ""definitive
  commitment one way or another at this point.""
      Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to
  buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln
  tonnes each of corn and wheat.
      Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of
  wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last
  September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.
      Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow
  would buy this year.
      ""I've seen people making comments on that and I don't know
  how they know, unless they talk to the Soviets,"" he said. ""I have
  no knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than the
  Soviets have any knowledge.""
      Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last
  month because ""they needed it and because the price was right.""
      ""Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think
  they've always found that our corn was good,"" he said.

1,"MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE
  Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill
  its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement
  depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official
  told Reuters.
      ""How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement
  if the United States does not want to offer us grain at
  competitive prices?"" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
  representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.
      ""We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the
  United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive
  prices,"" he said in an interview.
      Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the
  agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at
  prevailing market prices.
      ""We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.
  We do not consider we are at fault,"" Melnikov said.
      Article I in the agreement states that ""purchases/sales of
  commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market
  price prevailing for these products at the time of
  purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.""
      ""The United States should supply to the Soviet Union
  definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the
  United States ready to supply this?"" he said.
      The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has
  been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he
  confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices
  remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.
      Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.
      ""If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,
  then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the
  United States to decide how these competitive prices will be
  offered,"" he said.
      Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets
  was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.
  He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,
  U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

0,"HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP
  Fresh, heavy rains caused further
  damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week
  to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade
  sources said.
      They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops
  were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production
  forecasts were made for all these crops.
      The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered
  more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and
  worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.
      The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires
  have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.
      The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.
      In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of
  200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area
  bordering on Uruguay.
      In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm
  in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.
      The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.
      Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be
  further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.
      The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the
  crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.
      Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to
  30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires provinces.
      The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been
  lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6
  mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower
  than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.
      The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to
  36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.
      The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the
  area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It
  will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather
  permitting.
      Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln
  tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4
  to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private
  producers put 1985/86 production.
      The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official
  figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.
      The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'
  targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.
      The production forecast was reduced to between three and
  3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4
  to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.
      The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln
  hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.
      The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least
  changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to
  7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.
      These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's
  record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,
  and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.
      The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the
  rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the
  sunlight needed for this crop, sources said.
      Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down
  further.
      The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still
  finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier
  in the season.
      Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern
  Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.

  The government's industry aid and
  protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission

  industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.
      The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance
  to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,
  he said in a statement.
      He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting
  marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the
  underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing
  Act expire.
      Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full
  examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.
      ""The inquiry will be required to take into account changes
  which have taken place in the industry as a result of the
  agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and
  the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,""
  he said.
      ""The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,
  as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger
  underwriting support from the government for the first time,"" he
  said.
      Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the
  guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian
  Wheat Board near the start of the season.
      The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the
  findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,
  Handling and Transport, Kerin said.
      He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its
  findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in
  later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the
  federal and state governments and the industry.

1,"ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER
  The Soviet Union's winter grain
  crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting
  conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of
  world weather and crop conditions said.
      Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the
  EF Hutton publication ""Global Crop News,"" said in her latest
  report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,
  from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.
      ""Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet
  winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,"" she said. ""But
  it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot
  will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the
  troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.""
      Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably
  prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat
  growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus
  received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.
      The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record
  lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its
  toll on Soviet winter crops, she said.
      However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had
  ample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority
  of crop areas from severe frost damage.
      The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains
  in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from
  Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,
  Martell said.
      She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop
  problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.
      Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on
  moisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather
  necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.
      Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986
  grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl
  accident may have contaminated more grain than originally
  thought and have to be made up with imports.
      However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last
  resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only
  just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the
  1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.
      Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980
  grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the
  USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.
      In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain
  imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union
  bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only
  24 pct of that total.
      While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87
  was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their
  estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.

  The U.S. Feedgrains Council is
  surprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunal's
  decision that imports of corn from the U.S. are materially
  injuring Canadian corn producers, a council spokesman said.
      ""At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade
  in the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is
  incomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much
  from the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would
  threaten that process by caving in to pressures for
  protectionism,"" council president Darwin E. Stolte said.
      Canada's finding will strain the U.S./Canadian trading
  relationship, could damage the future of U.S. feedgrains

  impact farm trade reform with other nations, the council said.

0,"USDA NOT PLANNING ANY MAJOR PRICING CHANGES
  The Agriculture Department is not
  considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted
  county prices, an Agriculture Department offical said.
      ""We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments
  or changes in our pricing,"" said Bob Sindt, USDA assistant
  deputy administrator for commodity operations.
      U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week
  USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at
  the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted
  prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.
      But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.
      ""If people are suggesting that we are going to make
  wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this,"" he
  said.
      Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of
  implementing more minor changes in its pricing system.
      ""We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide
  structure to maintain its accuracy,"" he said. ""If we become
  convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate
  adjustments will be made.""
      Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA's
  price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior
  markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge
  freight rates.
      He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph
  Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and
  will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.
      Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that
  meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn
  premiums.
      He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price
  margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and
  that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or
  decrease.
      The USDA official also said that only those counties that
  use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the
  high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.
      When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which
  allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space
  and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted
  the idea.
      He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and
  that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be
  emptied by the end of March.

  Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's
  state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65
  pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural
  industry sources said.
      They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to
  around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60
  pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial
  farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.
      Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries
  since 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food
  shortage in Zimbabwe.
      While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000
  tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes,
  which means that even with the sharply reduced production this
  year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.
      The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a
  25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from
  248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean
  deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

  Torrential rains throughout
  Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse
  grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
      Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly
  affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to
  soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or
  May.
      The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum
  crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields
  and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.
      Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,
  with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,
  between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10
  and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40
  mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.
      No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.
      Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of
  the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.
      Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa
  Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of
  total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.
      Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was
  estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to
  seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the
  1985/86 harvest.
      Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11
  mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6
  mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,
  or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to
  official figures.
      The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine
  pct of total planted area.
      Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers
  for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure
  of 3.14 mln hectares.
      Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln
  and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and
  41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the
  1985/86 harvest.
      Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and
  four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to
  1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln
  hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
      Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and
  3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2
  million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.
      Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a
  record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of
  11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3
  mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures
  put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.
      Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good
  condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.
      Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is
  expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to
  13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.

1,"ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER
  The Soviet Union's winter grain
  crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting
  conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of
  world weather and crop conditions said.
      Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the
  EF Hutton publication ""Global Crop News,"" said in her latest
  report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,
  from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.
      ""Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet
  winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,"" she said. ""But
  it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot
  will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the
  troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.""
      Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably
  prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat
  growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus
  received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.
      The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record
  lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its
  toll on Soviet winter crops, she said.
      However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had
  ample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority
  of crop areas from severe frost damage.
      The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains
  in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from
  Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,
  Martell said.
      She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop
  problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.
      Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on
  moisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather
  necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.
      Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986
  grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl
  accident may have contaminated more grain than originally
  thought and have to be made up with imports.
      However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last
  resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only
  just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the
  1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.
      Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980
  grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the
  USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.
      In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain
  imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union
  bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only
  24 pct of that total.
      While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87
  was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their
  estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.

1,"U.S.-SOVIET GRAIN ACCORD QUESTIONED BY LYNG
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grain
  agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.
      ""It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....They
  haven't lived up to the agreement as I see it,"" Lyng said in an
  interview with Reuters.
      ""It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to
  work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to
  be a one-sided thing,"" he said.
      However, Lyng said he did not want to make a ""definitive
  commitment one way or another at this point.""
      Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to
  buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln
  tonnes each of corn and wheat.
      Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of
  wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last
  September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.
      Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow
  would buy this year.
      ""I've seen people making comments on that and I don't know
  how they know, unless they talk to the Soviets,"" he said. ""I have
  no knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than the
  Soviets have any knowledge.""
      Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last
  month because ""they needed it and because the price was right.""
      ""Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think
  they've always found that our corn was good,"" he said.

1,"U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT
  The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
  actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
  Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
  officials said.
      However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
  been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
  the very near future.
      ""The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,""
  an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ""But there
  just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.""
      Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
  than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
  Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
  when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
  this week.
      But administration and private sources agreed that if the
  Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
  Moscow, it could take several months.
      ""I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
  interagency process,"" the aide to Lyng said.
      ""An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,""
  said one former USDA official, who noted that the
  administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
  China wheat under the subsidy program.
      An official representing a large grain trade company said
  deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
  Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
  subsidy offer to the Soviets.
      But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
  Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
  secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
      The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
  comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
  clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
  at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
      In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
  administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
  new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
  consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm,
  basic, factual economics.""
      Another USDA official said there was ""not even an informal
  suggestion or hint"" that the Soviets would live up to their
  pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
  granted more favorable terms.
      USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
  EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
  delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
  from the Iran arms affair.

1,"JAPAN CUTTING CHINA CORN COMMITMENTS - USDA
  Japanese traders have apparently
  sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next
  six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department
  said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling
  to sell at current low world prices.
      If the reports are confirmed, China's major export
  destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could

1,"AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES
  The directors of the American Farm
  Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday
  to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without
  alterations.
      ""We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,""
  said Dean Kleckner, president. ""The current farm bill has been
  in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment
  there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining
  the legislation.
      ""Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm
  bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being
  advanced,"" Kleckner said.
      The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as
  he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans
  competitive in the world market.
      A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be
  eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK
  certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and
  the new loan rate.
      The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency
  payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat

      The report, dated March 27, said many sources have stated
  that the Soviet Union was initially interested in purchasing

"
1,"INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW
  Indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow
  by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
  in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
  declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
      Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to
  fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
  26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
  Indonesia""s agricultural performance.
      The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
  26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
  1987.
      The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
  tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
  a drawdown on stocks.
      ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
  promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
  production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
  gain,"" the report says.
      ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
  to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
  and palm kernels.""
      Constraints to significant overall increases in
  agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
  seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
  farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
  report underlines.
      The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
  pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
  largely offset gains in yields.
      The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
  insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
  resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
  resistant rice types.
      The government is depending on increased production of
  export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
  palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
  oil prices.
      Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
  in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
  to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
  report says.
      But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
  rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
  also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
      The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
  meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
  September""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
  in domestic demand.
      The report said that Indonesia""s overall economic
  performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
  negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
  mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
  in 1984.
      The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
  for the slump.

  A cold air mass working its way
  south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red
  winter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat
  specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.
      ""There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along
  so that it's probably vulnerable,"" Krenzler said.
      Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving
  from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's
  fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a
  low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the
  system.
      If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit
  Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures
  could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.
      Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop
  has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more
  vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.
      ""We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26
  degrees (fahrenheit),"" Krenzler said, ""as long as we don't have
  a lot of wind.""
      ""If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we
  have a good chance of significant damage to the heads,"" he
  said.
      Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and
  southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.
  Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed
  and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.

  Total food aid needs in 69 of the
  least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments
  fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the
  U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the
  department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a
  record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.
      However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by
  drought-reduced crops and civil strife.
      Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat
  consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding
  varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat
  is a common crop, it said.
      However, may developing countries in tropical climates,
  such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central
  America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and
  improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the
  department said.
      World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in
  1986/87 for the third straight year.
      Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil
  consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department

1,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS
  Three geographically diverse droughts
  in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a
  reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino
  weather pattern, &lt;Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather
  forecasting service, said.
      Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane
  growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face
  serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive
  in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government
  officials and meteorologists said.
      Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said
  the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces
  have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.
      Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.
      Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan
  was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for
  over 20 years, the paper said.
      The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct
  compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many
  rivers, it added.
      This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing
  shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the
  Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many
  ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.
      Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across
  China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has
  recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average
  since early February.
      The New China News Agency said the average December
  temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher
  than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.
      Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka
  and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of
  Plantation Industries officials told Reuters
      In Australia, concern is growing about below-average
  rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the
  Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local
  Meteorological Bureau officials said.
      For many farmers and government officials the fear is that
  while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major
  threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the
  wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.
      Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought
  which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the
  occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as
  El Nino, they said.
      Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the
  Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single
  cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.
      Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for
  agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'
  was unique.
      The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and
  the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last
  major event in 1982/83, it said.
      El Nino, Spanish for ""Christ Child"" because it appears around
  Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds
  and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast
  of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with
  the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade
  winds, meteorologists said.
      The winds, strengthened by El Nino's ""pump"" effect, raise the
  sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.
      When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends
  a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it
  collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.
      One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the
  rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the
  Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.
      The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather
  said.
      China, where the affected areas have received between 40
  and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the
  May-September rains, it said.
      The May-September rains normally provide the
  drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.
      In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have
  received less than half the normal rainfall during the current
  wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing
  as the rainy season draws to an end.
      In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be
  at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually
  occur between April and June, although it is not possible at
  this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.

"
1,"ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U.S. WHEAT
  The Soviet Union would likely be more
  interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any
  grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.
  wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.
      Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases
  until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known
  make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,
  director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.
      ""Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered
  a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond
  to,"" Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness
  education conference here. But if there are too many
  constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less
  than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.
      Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put Soviet
  Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy
  offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,
  Moscow would likely buy more, he said.
      ""If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I
  expect they'll take it,"" said Vernon McMinimy, director of
  commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
      McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on
  crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a
  subsidy offer.
      Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because
  of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter
  ""they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than
  normal,"" McMinimy said.

1,"U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES
  From April through December 1986,
  the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs
  worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not
  been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in
  certificates has been authorized for issuance during
  January-August, 1987.
      These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn
  and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department
  said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.
      Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain
  more competitive on world markets, it said.
      The department said last summer, for example, certificates
  were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped
  increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices
  averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they
  would have otherwise.
      The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40
  to 50 mln bushels, it said.
      The department said government spending on farm programs in
  fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from
  1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.
      During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half
  of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,
  annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last
  year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.
      The department said the President's budget proposals for
  1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24
  billion dlrs.
      In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain
  close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct
  average of 1980-86, it said.
      Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume
  is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven
  years, the department said.
