1,"FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987
  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
  (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
      FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
  Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
      World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
      ""Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests,"" FAO said.
      FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
      FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
  substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.

1,"ALBERTA SEEDING VIRTUALLY COMPLETE
  Ninety-six pct of Alberta and
  northeastern British Columbia crops have been seeded, about a
  week ahead of the 10 year average, according to the Alberta
  wheat pool report.
      Hard red spring wheat accounts for most acreage with 6.0
  mln estimated for this year, little changed from last year.
  Oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barley
  area of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year. Rapeseed planting
  of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. The
  south and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture with
  germination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areas
  are generally in the good to very good range.
     Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peace
  areas, the wheat pool said.

1,"USDA CHANGES LOW PROTEIN WHEAT TERMINAL PRICES
  The U.S. Agriculture Department has
  lowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red
  winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a
  senior USDA official said.
      USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas
  City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32
  cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy
  administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural
  Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.
      The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red
  spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.
      In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard
  red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to
  be identified said.
      The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,
  Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at
  Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.
      The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll
  activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon
  last week and will be effective today, he said.
      Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums
  on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat
  prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein
  premium would remain unchanged.

0,"DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS
  A prolonged dry spell has damaged
  111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
  in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials
  said.
      They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
  estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
  rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
  conditions continued until next month.
      Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the
  losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
  other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
  spell.
      Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
  representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
  mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.
      About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
  170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
      Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
  hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
  thus the damage is considered negligible.
      In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
  production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
  into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
       The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production
  in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to
  320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no
  reports of actual damage.

0,"ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE
  The Zambian government has no immediate
  plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
  maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
  official of the ruling party said.
      Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
  refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
  which at least 15 people died.
      That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
  revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
  (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
      However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
  dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
  increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
  a practice discouraged by the IMF.
      ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
  meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
  demands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry of
  Agriculture economist said.

1,"BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN
  Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade
  ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the
  country's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure
  for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.
      The government welcomed a decision by the Australian
  Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to
  Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected
  government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.
      The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,
  fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union
  decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice
  and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.
      Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar
  industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.
      In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the
  Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be
  a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience
  to press for his reinstatement.

      About 14.54 mln hectares of wheat were affected in 1986.
      The paper said abnormal weather conditions had encouraged
  the spread of wheat midges in 2.47 mln hectares in Shanxi,
  Henan, Sichuan, Anhui, Hebei and Jiangsu.

  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
  year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.

1,"INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88
  India's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
      Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
      The report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
      Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
      The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
     India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending March 31, 1990.
      Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
      ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued,"" it said.

  At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240
  mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past
  few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an
  official in the National Food Authority (NFA).
      The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage
  and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have
  jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was
  aimed at saving foreign currency.
      The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as
  saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes
  against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.
      Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150
  hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn
  worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.
      The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician,
  as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total
  inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is
  expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.

  China has raised the state purchase
  prices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April
  1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official China
  Commercial Daily said.
      The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern
  provinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50
  kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the
  price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.
      The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10
  southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.
      The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11
  provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest
  China has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no
  more price details.
      It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price
  increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage
  production of grains and oilseeds.
      Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow
  grain because they can earn more from other crops.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
  Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
      In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
  USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
  Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
  month.
      USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising""
  because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
      All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
  USDA said.
      Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
  mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
  miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
      USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
  through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
      The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in above
  average winter-kill,"" USDA said.
      Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
  maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
  grain recently.
      USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
  grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
  and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.

0,"BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS
  Storage problems with Brazil's record
  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
  tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
      Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
      He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
  harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
  problems.
      Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
      But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
  distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
      The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
  capacity.
      Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
      In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
  storing loose grain, Brito said.
      Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
  crops.
      The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
  has been evident from television reports, which have shown
  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

      Spain is threatened with massive imports from third
  countries by the end of the year, they said.
      They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the
  accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will
  import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
  into Spain from third countries this year.
      Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a
  reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may
  decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to
  make direct purchases.
      The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries
  should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
  Spanish market.
      They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC
  Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
  would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.

  There will be no serious bids at European

  department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat
  under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local
  opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been
  delaying deliveries.
      As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well
  as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers
  and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.
      The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal
  remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that
  had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French
  wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

  Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct
  to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a
  year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.
      The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
  poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
  cattle raising, Ministry officials said.
      Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were
  217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
      Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
  from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
      The officials said corn imports rose because the world
  surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
  Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
  1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
      Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
  18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due
  to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
  Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
      Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
  the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
      The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
  increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
      Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
  528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct
  from 2.1 pct.

  The Zambian government today announced
  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
  economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
  northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
      However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
  sweeping reductions.
      Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
  small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
  items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
      Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said
  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
      In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
      President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
      The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
  strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity
  program.
      Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of
  unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
  region to take action against shops that did not reduce their

1,"NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG
  The Soviets have not indicated an
  urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
  that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
  expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng told Reuters.
      In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
  not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
  subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
      ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
  There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
  there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
  wheat subsidy).""
      When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
  summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""
      The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
  Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
  discussion at a summit.
      ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
  Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
  about,"" Lyng said.
      ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
  agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
  not something that would be discussed with the President of the
  United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.
      Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
  producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
  still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
  decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
      The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
  will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
  Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
  long-standing agreement.
      ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
  failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
  love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
  but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
  These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""
      When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
  the agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn't
  been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
  they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
  agreement.""

1,"FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED
  Argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
      They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
      However, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
      The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
      Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
      Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
  not been as intense as in previous years.

0,"U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO SPEED UP CORN PAYMENTS
  The House Agriculture Committee voted
  to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency
  payments immediately instead of in the late fall.
      A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate
  floor last week.
      The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
  so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than
  late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
  be changed.
      Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending
  into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to
  meet stiff resistance in the full House.

1,"FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
      The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
  end-of-season stocks.
      However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
      The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
      This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
      ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
  official said.
      Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
      He said, however, that among countries to which France
  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
      The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
      Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
      It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

1,"BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT
  Based on field travel in the
  Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
  average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
      The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
  20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
      It said generally favorable weather from early December
  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
      However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
  report said.
      The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
  serious storage problems, the report said.
      Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
  expected to be above average, it said.
      Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
  crop has been harvested.
      During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
  elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
  report said.
      New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
  accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
  for the decline are expected reduced government support price
  and good summer crop harvests.

0,"RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN
  Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt
  brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier
  this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome
  moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
  according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather
  Inc.
      ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three
  days,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
  above normal moisture this week.""
      Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
  Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
  Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
      Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
  were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
      Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
  thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
      ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a
  pretty good rain,"" Mohler said.
      Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking
  an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of
  Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off
  19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.
      Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is
  expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north
  later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across
  the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as
  early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage
  in early July, he said.
  

"
0,"SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL
  Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
  controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
  farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
  approve of the proposal.
      The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
  bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
  soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
  planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
  for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
      Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
  sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
  nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
  first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
  examining farm programs.
      Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
  ""Family Farm Act.""
      -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
  and reduce government spending on agriculture.
      -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
  ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
  increase overall revenue from exports.
      This would be done by seeking agreement among major
  exporting countries including the European Community on market
  sharing at agreed high prices.
      Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
  that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
      -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
  would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
  stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from
  high farm product prices.
      Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on
  equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
  Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
  Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
  Quaker Oats.
      -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would
  be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
      He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
  allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
  grain stocks for three years.
      Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
  ""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.
      -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
  participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current
  farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
  programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
  farm income.

1,"FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED
  Argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
      They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
      However, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
      The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
      Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
      Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
  not been as intense as in previous years.

1,"FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
      The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
  end-of-season stocks.
      However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
      The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
      This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
      ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
  official said.
      Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
      He said, however, that among countries to which France
  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
      The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
      Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
      It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

      USSR wheat imports are forecast at 15.00 mln tonnes in
  1986/87, vs 15.00 mln tonnes last month. Imports in 1985/86 are
  put at 15.70 mln tonnes, vs 15.70 mln tonnes last month. USDA

  tonnes, vs 10.00 mln tonnes last month, and 1985/86 imports at
  13.70 mln tonnes, vs 13.70 mln tonnes last month.
      USDA said Soviet coarse grain imports include 1986/87 corn
  imports, which it forecast at 8.00 mln tonnes, vs 6.00 mln
  tonnes last month. Corn imports in 1985/86 are estimated at
  10.40 mln tonnes, vs 10.40 mln last month.

  Some producers in the 1987 acreage
  reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92
  pct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted
  with wheat or other program crops, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster
  Assistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat
  producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented
  from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural
  disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop
  acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's
  permitted acreage.
      A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction
  program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July
  15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when
  applications are being accepted, it said.
      The department said producers of wheat other than winter
  wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
  planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987
  because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if
  the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home
  Administration for emergency loans for such disasters that

  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
      ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,
  said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
  its farm import market,"" he said.
      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next March 31.
      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
      ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official
  said.

  Based on field travel in the
  Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
  average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
      The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
  20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
      It said generally favorable weather from early December
  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
      However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
  report said.
      The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
  serious storage problems, the report said.
      Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
  expected to be above average, it said.
      Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
  crop has been harvested.
      During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
  elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
  report said.
      New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
  accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
  for the decline are expected reduced government support price
  and good summer crop harvests.

0,"BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS
  U.S. House and Senate budget
  negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
  yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
  on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.
      The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
  billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.
      The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
  farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
  total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
      The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
  committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
  agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
  without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
  Congressional aides told Reuters.
      Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
  the budget savings.
      Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
      House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
      But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
  savings Glickman claims.
      Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
  ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
      However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
  within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
      Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
  unfair to one commodity.
      Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
      Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
  but not enough, they said.
      Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
      This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau
  Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

  Australia could lose valuable wheat
  markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
  coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
  Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
      ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
  true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
  valuable markets,"" he said in a statement.
      Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
  spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
  farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
  back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
      However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
  cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
  facing enormous financial pressures.
      He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
  hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
  16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
  intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
      If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
  plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
  with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
  wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
      ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
  understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
  will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
  decrease production,"" Condon said.
      ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
  income earner, governments and government authorities will need
  to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
  viability of the wheat industry,"" he added.
      Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
  Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

1,"SENATE PANEL STUDIES LOAN RATE, SET ASIDE PLANS
  The Senate Agriculture Committee was
  expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in
  county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and
  wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.
      A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy
  (D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate
  differentials to no more than one pct per year from the
  national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.
      The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to
  increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by
  ""an appropriate amount to generate savings"" if projected corn
  stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.
      Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set
  aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.

0,"NET CHANGE IN EXPORT COMMITMENTS -- USDA
  The U.S. Agriculture Department gave
  the net change in export commitments, including sales,
  cancellations, foreign purchases and cumulative exports, in the
  current seasons through the week ended April 2, with
  comparisons, as follows, in tonnes, except as noted --
                          4/2/87   Prev Week
              All Wheat   119,800    368,300

              Cotton-Y     60,200     31,900
     x-minus total. Y-running bales.
      The indicated totals include reported commitments to both
  named and unnamed destinations, sales on exporters' own account
  and optional origin sales plus actual exports already made
  during the respective marketing seasons.
      The USDA cautions that reported outstanding sales are
  subject to modification, deferral or cancellation and it is
  unlikely that all reported quantities will be exported.
      USDA gave detailed breakdowns for the 1986/87 and 1987/88
  seasons as follows, in thousand tonnes unless stated --
   (A) - Firm sales to a declared destination.
   (B) - Ultimate destination not yet declared.
   (C) - Sales made on exporters' own account.
   (D) - Exporter holds option to fill commitment with supplies 
  from origins other than U.S.
   (E) - Accumulated exports since season began based on data 
  reported by exporters.
   (F) - Indicated total for season.
   (G) - USDA-projected exports for season.
   Note -- Totals may not add due to rounding.

1,"EXPORT BONUS WHEAT FLOUR TO IRAQ --USDA
  The Commodity Credit Corporation
  (CCC) accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover a sale of
  12,500 tonnes of U.S. wheat flour to Iraq, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The department said the bonus awarded was 105.82 dlrs per
  tonne and the wheat flour is for shipment July 1-10, 1987.
      The bonus was awarded to The Pillsbury Company and will be
  paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks.
      An additional 150,000 tonnes of wheat flour is still
  available to Iraq under the Export Enhancement Program
  initiative announced January 7, 1987, the department said.

0,"GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT
  Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize
  imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,
  the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.
      Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey
  made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes
  of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid
  programme.
      The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows
  government concern over ""lower than average rainfall in southern
  Ghana and its implications for the major harvest.""
      Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing
  areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of
  Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all
  major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
      GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences
  of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
  experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
  alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
      The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously
  affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts
  of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have
  dried up.

1,"EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA
  The European Community (EC) agreed a
  trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
  following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
  officials said.
      Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
  including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
      But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
  Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
  officials said.
      The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
  states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
  quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
      Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
  substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
  officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
  improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
      Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
      The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
  that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
  on Tariffs and Trade).
      But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
  been affected by the country's EC membership.
      Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
  fish dispute with Canada.
      Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
  claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
  with Japanese offers of compensation.
      Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
  citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
  journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
  concessions were not enough.""
      ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said.
