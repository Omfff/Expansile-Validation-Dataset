"" clinton announced this push specifically to introduce a 4 / 93 bill for farming and support wheat and feedgrains. an aide to glickman confirmed that it will probably be tested tomorrow week. she said a 0 / 92 program, which permits a person to sell it and still make only more of his market payments, would not be a forceful revision of the 1985 farms bill - - only an overthrow of the 15 / 94 provision legally offered under the prior plan. it is premature to make any major revision in the agrarian law, he believed, but if farmer has to make further cuts to meet proposed limits, a true 10 / 93 referendum could be worse than heavily cutting corn prices, as usda has proposed. a 5 / 92 plan, overall, will not be decoupling, but as a particular type of acreage conservation initiatives, glickman argues. decoupling - - recovering energy credits from harvesting decisions - - is too much of a policy move to advocate at this level, he said. "" i don't think there is any alternative in pursuing a similar initiative this year. unacceptable. unequivocal, "" johnson acknowledged at the hearing. dr. eric schmidt ( r - minn. ), author of the boren / jackson decoupling plan, said he favored a short term 30 / 82 proposal as a complement to a more complex decoupling phase. obama plans to pursue a 30 / 91 plan in the us. his plan to mandate a certain fee payment to participating states, requiring that all acreage be allocated to conservation use only, tax clearing and grazing on his farm fields, grant participation to a greater portion of runs in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.

"iwc says effect of this support level is efforts by countries to restore price surpluses by cutting wheat prices have tried with only considerable difficulty, the international wheat board ( iwc ) says in its latest monthly meeting. faster results should be prevented by a pressure of stimulating both labor and production, as present in the united states, the iwc mentions in a survey of support levels in the six main payments sources - argentina, india, pakistan, the ec and the u. s. in some countries, for all brazil and argentina, which are heavily dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be failures in reaching yield. a pressure of lowering wheat quantities should lead to disruption, with huge numbers of us improving. failed crops may acquire inferior results which could then result to lost taxation revenue and market of nations stabilization. the iwc explains both alternatives of action leading to governments in western donor countries. they should continue to cut prices in the hope that when the world itself improves demand for energy will rise and surpluses wil be abandoned or abolished. moreover, support will be limited to wheat which might be readily consumed, not needing to be made for a busy period. this option may increase to be the most politically profitable and possibly bring in many farmers abandoning food shipments, the report claims. the third alternative must be for farmers to differentiate between the commercial and enterprise aspects of industry, not setting these points strictly to specific needs or relative income. the iwc review examined farm prices in the average income countries since 1982. at some points during that period all the administrations cut support prices in proportion to projected surpluses. these events did not always result in lower export yields as on many areas currency fluctuations more than eroded lower prices in the domestic system. for example between 1978 / 87 and 1983 / 87 the domestic program prices for bread wheat changed from 209. 30 to 179. 0 euro union peg ( 1983 ). it lowered prices, the currency in which most food transactions are covered, the intervention price being dropping to 50 dlrs from 2010. the rising risk of supporting farm prices has put a weight on national income and some provinces are now searching for ways to improve it, the review says. the proportion of world food producers covered by the five cotton exporters declined in the range covered by the study from 40 pct in 1985 to 50 pct in 1990. this was partly due to income inequality in argentina and india. the study saw an overall decline in agriculture, although this was countered [UNK] [UNK] argentina, [UNK] u. s. and australia [UNK] lower acreages. in argentina [UNK] reduction [UNK] [UNK] sown area [UNK] [UNK] 20 per cent [UNK] put [UNK] [UNK] low prices causing producers [UNK] switch [UNK] [UNK] enterprises, particularly livestock [UNK] lower u. s. acreages [UNK] attributed [UNK] official incentives.",1

"portuguese grain regulation agency or ban is opposed by treasury minister in portugal's deputy agriculture resources minister alvaro jaime barreto he said he had disagreed with a court disciplinary order barring the state regulating grain or buying establishment agency or epac from concurrently taking part in cereals alongside import tenders that open to existing private traders. barreto also told multiple reporters his campaign aim was to have epac directly readmitted to the tenders. under the terms of minister portugal's 17 january 1986 portugal accession to the contemporary european monetary community ( ec ), a grain import service monopoly held by the epac ( ce empresa publica galicia de abastecimento americana de cereais ) is being seriously reduced by 20 cent pct credits annually until all imports are officially liberalised in march 1990. in following legal proceedings by seven private energy importers, lisbon's civil court decided in a similar preliminary ruling earlier this june month that its epac should not be explicitly allowed to take some part, as it had already done, in international tenders for the sharply liberalised market share of annual mexican grain imports. as a result of this final ruling, that epac was not excluded from a 29 march 2009 12 tender for the intended import of another 80, 100 000 metric tonnes of maize. justice barreto said, "" my objective is we put more epac into the import tenders because it has a legal right to take part.

"" there is no reasonable reason to deliberately make the epac a true martyr of the metric system, "" barreto also said. he said the 2010 ec's national executive power commission had slowly accepted the government's view that independent epac should be eligible. the 2010 lisbon court ruling stated that epac's failed participation in the 2011 public business tenders was deeply unfair to competition and possibly violated the exclusion clauses of portugal's 1986 ec accession accession treaty before dealing with the ongoing gradual permanent dismantling of the portuguese state food agency's commodity import monopoly.",0

"concern over "" el nino "" in peru - usda report there are heightened fears that "" el nino "" may be returning to peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought, the u. s. agriculture department's officer in lima said in a field training report. continued by heavy rains in the affected northern national coastal tourist area, rapid flooding of to several major rivers and mud mountain slides have often led to increased international concern, the report, dated after march 7 17, 1982 said. however, it was said official sources to still believe that this year's future el del nino will have only weak to less moderate an intensity. 1 el this nino is a similar phenomenon involving a dramatic shift in river winds and waters in the northeast pacific. the usda report however said that so very far the real el del nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural rice production. excessive rains in the remote piura pima cotton area may even reduce yields by about 8 20 times pct mainly due to and excessive corn growth too already early in the crop cycle. perhaps also insect impact damage to other crops however could be more extensive where any excessive rice moisture still exists, it reports said. however, the extreme el el nino has probably resulted in a much improved quality supply of irrigation irrigation using water in the major stream dams which will improve its prospects for many other crucial coffee crops such as canned rice and nut corn, and slow the decline in agricultural sugar bee production, it said. if total el nino again picks up momentum, peru's fishing tourism industry output could still receive a setback. but most trade market sources still largely believe the raw fish catch for the industrial fish processing will definitely reach 5. 8 5 millions mln tonnes in march 1987, almost just 20 pct above last year, the report said. their water supply temperatures in the affected northern fishing concession areas are three to last four degrees to centigrade above its normal but although still not high enough to permanently drive the fish to the cooler southern water waters, it is said. it said there is still the outside chance that possibly el nino will gradually intensify and carry on through by late march, long april and finally may march causing serious problems as crops eventually approach the harvest.

"" if the soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what argentina can provide during the april to june period, "" he said. current competitive prices for u. s. corn have also sparked soviet buying. u. s. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, argentine corn for 67 dlrs - - a very competitive price spread, u. s. and soviet sources said.

"u. s. corn market skewed by soviet buying recent purchases of u. s. corn by the soviet union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said. many dealers expect the usda will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the gulf versus the interior - - which a dealer in davenport, iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel - - by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain. by lowering ascs county posted prices for corn, the usda could encourage farmers to engage in pik and roll corn sales, where pik certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed. if the usda acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the gulf corn basis. "" the usda has been using the gulf price to determine county posted prices, "" one dealer said. "" it should be taking the average of the gulf price and the price in kansas city, "" which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior midwest. "" but we don't know when they might do it, "" an ohio dealer said, which has created uncertainty in the market. the usda started the pik certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage. yesterday, usda issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3. 85 billion dlrs in pik certificates it has issued to farmers ( in lieu of cash payments ) had to date been exchanged for grain. with several billion dlrs worth of additional pik certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the usda would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ascs prices, cash grain dealers said. a byproduct of the soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the midwest to the export terminals, cash dealers said. freight from upper areas of the mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price. the mild winter and early reopening of the mid - mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted. the higher transportation costs have served to depress agricultural interior corn basis levels, squeezing [UNK] margins obtained [UNK] [UNK] elevators feeding [UNK] gulf export market [UNK] well [UNK] discouraging farmer marketings, [UNK] said.

"u. s. sugar program cut sent to congress by usda the u. s. agriculture department formally transmitted to congress a long - awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments. in a letter to the congressional leadership accompanying the "" sugar program improvements act of 1987 "", peter myers, deputy agriculture secretary, said the reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now. sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. the payments would cost an estimated 1. 1 billion dlrs, myers said. the administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the house of representatives next week by rep. john porter, r - ill. congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the house or senate because politically - influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist. the direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. it also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20, 000 short tons raw sugar per grower. for example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4. 5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1. 5 cts in 1991. the income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, usda said. myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry. he said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads. u. s. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a "" progressive contraction "" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. this has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing. furthermore, usda said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar - containing products a competitive advantage. the result has been higher imports of sugar - containing products and a flight of u. s. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar. usda also however said [UNK] current program imposes [UNK] heavy cost [UNK] u. s. consumers [UNK] industrial users. in fiscal 1987, usda said consumers [UNK] paying nearly two billion dlrs [UNK] [UNK] necessary [UNK] sugar.

"usda not planning any major pricing changes the agriculture department is not considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices, an agriculture department offical said.

"" if we become convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate adjustments will be made. "" sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that usda's price differentials between the new orleans gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates. he said commodity operations deputy chief administrator ralph richard klopfenstein is both currently in the midwest on a speaking style tour and will meet with ascs oficials in neighboring kansas city the next week. sindt said a considerable number of the issues will be widely discussed at that meeting, some including the current government concern over the foreign gulf handling corn cost premiums. he particularly defended the usda cost differentials, saying that these seasonal price adjustment margins merely reflect an inadequate average of annual prices raised throughout the year and that higher seasonal demand factors will almost normally cause these prices to quickly increase or decrease. the chief usda division official also said that only those large counties that effectively use the gulf to consistently price grain are being deemed currently affected by the high monthly barge freight rate tariffs and increased international gulf prices. when publicly asked if the new usda emergency and storage recycling program which currently allows processing grain to be quickly stored in larger barges was currently taking up barge parking space and was accounting for the anticipated higher barge freight rates, sindt discounted the proposed idea. he said city usda has most grain left in only about 250 bay barges and that, under different provisions of the container program, these all have to be promptly emptied by the late end of march.",0

"" in determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate... the risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered, "" according to the analysis.

"" growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 don't look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain, "" the report says. "" the modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels. "" constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "" wereng "" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower - yielding, more resistant rice types. the government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7. 0 pct in 1987 to 1. 45 mln tonnes from 1. 35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720, 000 tonnes from 695, 000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. but while production of soybeans in 1987 / 88 ( oct - sept ) will rise to 1. 075 mln tonnes from 980, 000 in 1986 / 87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. the report says that imports of wheat, maize soy ##beans, soybean meal [UNK] cotton [UNK] [UNK] likely [UNK] decline [UNK] [UNK] result [UNK] last september "" [UNK] 31 pct devaluation [UNK] [UNK] rupiah [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] rise [UNK] domestic demand. the report said [UNK] indonesia "" [UNK] overall economic performance [UNK] calendar 1986 [UNK] [UNK] zero [UNK] even [UNK] slight negative growth rate, [UNK] lowest rate [UNK] growth since [UNK] mid - 1960s. it compares [UNK] 1. 9 pct growth [UNK] 1985 [UNK] 6. 7 pct [UNK] 1984. the dramatic fall [UNK] oil prices last year [UNK] responsible [UNK] [UNK] slump.",1

"amstutz sees more of bullish world wheat outlook in august 1987 by u. s. agriculture undersecretary joseph daniel amstutz has indicated the maize world crop wheat product supply / feed demand situation has suddenly become more severely bullish starting recently because of latest developments in the grain world market and consequently increased agriculture consumption. speaking to a national house for agriculture appropriations board subcommittee, amstutz then cited two three important factors which have improved the global wheat demand outlook. he specifically said world consumption of most wheat is increasing by about about 20 mln tonnes this financial year, primarily primarily for livestock feed and use. there are also differing reports from western australia, canada and argentina that wheat plantings have been reduced, he further said. but furthermore, he furthermore cited detailed reports of greater than normal winterkill in the 1970s soviet soviet union.

"iwc says effect of lower support prices limited efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success, the international wheat council ( iwc ) says in its latest monthly report. faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas, as employed in the united states, the iwc says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - argentina, australia, canada, the ec and the u. s. in some countries, for example australia and argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production. a policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems. the iwc outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries. they could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated. alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period. this option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said. the third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production. the iwc review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. at some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses. these changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency. for example between 1985 / 86 and 1986 / 87 the ec intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209. 30 to 179. 44 european currency units ( ecus ). it dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. the high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says. the proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. this was partly due to increased production in china and india. the period saw an upward trend in export yields, although this was countered [UNK] [UNK] argentina, [UNK] u. s. and australia [UNK] lower acreages. in argentina [UNK] reduction [UNK] [UNK] sown area [UNK] [UNK] 20 per cent [UNK] put [UNK] [UNK] low prices causing producers [UNK] switch [UNK] [UNK] enterprises, particularly livestock [UNK] lower u. s. acreages [UNK] attributed [UNK] official incentives.",1

"" they have an aggressive buying campaign from the european community, from canada, from the u. s. they're active buyers from all sources at this point, "" the official said in explaining why the department raised its soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes. this is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the ussr might not buy any u. s. corn for the first time in 15 years. a drawdown of corn supplies in china and argentina, concern over soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for u. s. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating moscow's recent interest. lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as japan, and the soviets are also closely watching the situation, the official said.

"awb calls for tighter wheat quality controls australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements, the australian wheat board ( awb ) said. "" many awb customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications, "" the board said in a submission to the royal commission into grain storage, handling and transport. "" many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in australia, "" it said. the commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system. australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower - quality grades, the awb submission said. it stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping. better industrial relations at grain terminals, more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing, it said. the submission also said australia's federal system impeded the awb's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat. the awb called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment. "" it is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored, "" it said. for example, wheat grown in northern new south wales ( nsw ) might move more efficiently to brisbane, in queensland, than to sydney or newcastle in new south wales, it said. similarly, southern nsw wheat might better be shipped to portland or south geelong, in victoria. early legislation giving victorian state and rail systems authorities a temporary monopoly over regional grain shipments was also one notable impediment, it said. the 2007 awb response said the current approach of state - based bulk wheat handling ports authorities is not simply essential, although it was said it favoured the maritime authorities for maintaining at at least their by current normal level of control of storage and transport as long as yield quality was adequately maintained. an electronic appendix on port loading costs consistently showed it will cost between between 26, 1000 500 and only 34, 700 pure u. s. line dlrs to load a 50, 500 000 - tonne vessel at various australian ports that compared with their 21, 200 dlrs at houston and as 16, 000 300 at national port cartier, quebec, for a 60, 200 000 - kilometer tonner.",1

"some cbt futures traders also look immediately ahead to planned spring plantings chicago mercantile board of foreign trade and grain securities traders and analysts voiced a parking lot of an interest in how crops farmers planned to eventually handle their scheduled upcoming spring agricultural plantings, regularly prompting sales of new three crop months of organic corn and oats and potential purchases in developing new crop green soybeans in the futures futures futures markets. trade professionals in the food grains livestock trade think that some farmers will be more willing to only stick with corn soy acres than to soybeans because additional corn is protected by the defense acreage deficiency reduction program. that organization gives back deficiency payments to more farmers if minimum corn prices stay too low. farmers can sometimes place soybeans under the loan program if they not sign - up for their reduced acreage, but they have no price impact guarantees. with the expected price savings outlook for both these commodities so unexpectedly dismal, commodity traders still believe the farmers will want to stick with a sure ole thing price rather than merely gamble on the soybeans, even over though the affordable new second crop soybean / corn production ratio of usa 2. 1 9 / us 1... would make not planting soybeans more attractive under reasonably normal commercial circumstances. an earlier announcement late this friday that the usda will then lift the mandatory limited and cross - section compliance license requirement for the may 1987 oats quality crop, has means farmers will be more able plant an annual estimated worth two to three dollar mln more oat acres this market year than on last tuesday without being further penalized, rice traders said. here too, acres some reform farmers recently may have been actively thinking of with shifting to means soybeans will now be planted with oats, although due to the more technically attractive deal from the bush government, they were added. standard cotton land prices are almost twice what they were just six short months in ago, which should prompt many farmers in the american south to put more soybean organic land further back into plain cotton. one of the direct reasons for the almost steady increase in soybean land production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton mill producing regions of the south to soybeans, which are easier to first grow, one commercial rice trader said.",1

"around 3. 5 mln acres said to be idled by 0 / 92 a 0 / 92 program would have very little impact on u. s. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3. 5 mln acres of cropland every year, according to a report from the agriculture department. the savings resulting from the additional 3. 5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10 - 20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said. the usda report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0 / 92 acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley. last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.

"commodity pacts more oriented towards market consuming countries, chastened by the collapse of international tin council ( itc ) price support operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving, a reuter survey showed. they want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords'support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non - members undermining the pacts. consumers and producers, mindful of itc buffer stock losses, have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations. importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey showed. the international cocoa organization ( icco ) last week set precise limits on what the buffer stock manager ( bsm ) could do under the new agreement. it imposed daily and weekly purchase limits, prohibited the bsm from operating on futures markets and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non - member cocoa. this will help prevent lower quality cocoa from malaysia, the world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market. the cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the buffer stock manager must use when purchasing varying grades. a new international natural rubber agreement ( inra ) was adopted earlier this month in geneva. importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations. direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases. bank financing was a particular feature of the failed itc buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling. legal wrangles continue. recent international coffee organization ( ico ) negotiations in london exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said. consumers and a small group of producers argued that "" objective criteria "" should be used to define export quota shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of brazil, the world's leading producer. brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct. the talks broke down and, although an ico executive board meeting starts in london today, delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote. international agreements now exist for sugar and wheat. these don't have [UNK] economic clauses [UNK] provide [UNK] forum [UNK] discussions [UNK] possible future economic agreements, collect statistics [UNK] draw [UNK] market analyses. analysts said differences [UNK] sugar exporting countries [UNK] held [UNK] [UNK] progress towards [UNK] accord [UNK] economic teeth, [UNK] sheer competition [UNK] major exporters amid [UNK] world grain glut militate [UNK] [UNK] pact [UNK] economic provisions [UNK] wheat. an alternative focus [UNK] commodity discussions [UNK] international study groups, made [UNK] [UNK] governments [UNK] advice [UNK] industry, [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] lead [UNK] zinc [UNK] rubber. the u. n. common fund [UNK] commodities, [UNK] [UNK] planned directly contributed capital [UNK] 470 mln dlrs, [UNK] failed [UNK] become operational [UNK] neither [UNK] u. s. nor [UNK] soviet union [UNK] ratified [UNK]. u. s. officials [UNK] washington said [UNK] u. s. doubts [UNK] fund would [UNK] able [UNK] fulfil [UNK] objectives, citing [UNK] lack [UNK] widespread support. u. s. officials [UNK] washington [UNK] malaysian officials [UNK] kuala lumpur expressed [UNK] policy [UNK] looking [UNK] [UNK] commodity pact case [UNK] case. u. s. officials said [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] willing [UNK] study individual cases [UNK] economically sound, market - oriented commodity accords balancing producer [UNK] consumer interests.

"shultz ussr trip fuels talk of eep wheat offer speculation the united states will offer subsidized wheat to the soviet union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run - up to secretary of state george shultz'visit later this month to moscow. rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary, semi - annual grain talks in february. moscow's decision at that time to reenter the u. s. corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects. shultz is set to arrive in moscow april 13. shultz'statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the export enhancement program, eep, coupled with the announcement of his visit to moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the reagan administration was preparing an offer. administration officials - - in and out of the u. s. agriculture department - - have been extremely tight - lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer. but usda officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer, while not a "" done deal, "" is a live possibility. prominent u. s. grain trade representatives - - many of whom asked not to be identified - - continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent. others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible, are saying they would not rule one out. rep. pat roberts, r - kan., yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks. aides to roberts said he had spoken to republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials. richard fritz, director of international marketing at u. s. wheat associates, said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month. fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer washington made peking earlier this year when usda approved subsidies to china of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat. some grain trade representatives say a four - mln - tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more soviet purchases of u. s. corn and open the door to u. s. sales of soybeans. as ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat tariff deal would appear [UNK] [UNK] price. last summer [UNK] administration took [UNK] controversial step [UNK] offering [UNK] soviets subsidized wheat - - [UNK] [UNK] embarrassed [UNK] moscow spurned [UNK] proposal [UNK] [UNK] grounds [UNK] [UNK] 15 - dlr - per - tonne subsidy still left u. s. wheat prices far [UNK] world market prices. the administration'[UNK] decision [UNK] set [UNK] subsidy level [UNK] front instead [UNK] accepting bids [UNK] exporters appeared [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] means [UNK] controlling [UNK] price [UNK] attempting [UNK] dampen criticism, grain trade sources said. nonetheless, [UNK] pricing procedure [UNK] [UNK] prevent shultz [UNK] saying [UNK] soviets [UNK] "" chortling "" [UNK] washington [UNK] offering soviet housewives cheaper grain [UNK] [UNK] available [UNK] u. s. housewives. the conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] general warming [UNK] relations [UNK] [UNK] two countries since last summer, combined [UNK] continued hard times [UNK] [UNK] u. s. grain belt, would favor [UNK] subsidy offer. in addition, [UNK] ussr [UNK] made [UNK] clear [UNK] would consider buying u. s. wheat [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] priced [UNK] competitively. however, observers [UNK] [UNK] forgotten [UNK] circumstances surrounding [UNK] administration'[UNK] announcement [UNK] [UNK] wheat subsidy offer last summer. up [UNK] [UNK] time [UNK] [UNK] announcment, congressional [UNK] industry leaders [UNK] led [UNK] believe [UNK] white house [UNK] decided [UNK] expand [UNK] export enhancement program [UNK] include [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] soviets, [UNK] also [UNK] much broader list [UNK] countries. instead, [UNK] administration scaled back [UNK] offer [UNK] include [UNK] [UNK] soviets. that last - minute change [UNK] heart adds [UNK] measure [UNK] uncertainty even [UNK] [UNK] predictions [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] convinced [UNK] [UNK] administration [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] pass [UNK] [UNK] opportunity [UNK] sell four mln tonnes [UNK] wheat [UNK] [UNK] soviet union.",1

"u. s. house approves pilot 0 / 92 disaster program the house of representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant. the one - time pilot 0 / 92 program, designed to assist farmers in kansas, oklahoma, michigan and parts of missouri, was passed by a 304 - 100 vote and sent to the senate. although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0 / 92 provision endorsed by the reagan administration, the u. s. agriculture department withheld its support from the measure. usda said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed broad - scale revision of farm programs. the bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received. to be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring, although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay. usda estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs, largely because of reduced crop forfeitures. the bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the missouri and mississippi rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall's flooding. in addition, the measure would require usda to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by congress last fall. currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds, usda plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses. the administration said it opposed the bill because, by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance. usda also said the 0 / 92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings. usda said the 0 / 92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the requirement to compensate fully disaster - struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by congress. the feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs. usda estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs. in august january the senate approved [UNK] bill [UNK] would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible [UNK] disaster assistance payments. but [UNK] senate bill would [UNK] offer [UNK] 0 / 92 option [UNK] wheat [UNK] feedgrains producers [UNK] raise [UNK] 400 - mln dlr ceiling [UNK] [UNK] disaster assistance program.",1

"" constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "" wereng "" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower - yielding, more resistant rice types. the government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7. 0 pct in 1987 to 1. 45 mln tonnes from 1. 35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720, 000 tonnes from 695, 000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. but while production of soybeans in 1987 / 88 ( oct - sept ) will rise to 1. 075 mln tonnes from 980, 000 in 1986 / 87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. the report says that imports of wheat, particularly soy ##beans, soybean meal [UNK] cotton [UNK] [UNK] likely [UNK] decline [UNK] [UNK] result [UNK] last september "" [UNK] 31 pct devaluation [UNK] [UNK] rupiah [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] rise [UNK] domestic demand. the report said [UNK] indonesia "" [UNK] overall economic performance [UNK] calendar 1986 [UNK] [UNK] zero [UNK] even [UNK] slight negative growth rate, [UNK] lowest rate [UNK] growth since [UNK] mid - 1960s. it compares [UNK] 1. 9 pct growth [UNK] 1985 [UNK] 6. 7 pct [UNK] 1984. the dramatic fall [UNK] oil prices last year [UNK] responsible [UNK] [UNK] slump.",1

"" The other job is it is frequently difficult to provide or buy commodity which the other company need. "" Another added, "" Swop is also restrictive.

"COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS Congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the U. S. Agriculture Department ' s generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how much the program has cost U. S. taxpayers. The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment - in - kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said. USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to re - examine the costs, sources - - including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates. The CCC issues dollar - denominated PIK certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash. Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3. 8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another 6. 7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987, according to USDA. Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate. Eliminating this practice, called "" PIK and roll, "" would save the government 1. 4 billion dlrs between 1988 - 92, according to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments. The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK - and - roll transactions among other savings alternatives. The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said. However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said. The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year. USDA ' s Economic Research Service, for example, has found that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel. Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained by Reuters.",0

"CONCERN OVER "" EL NINO "" IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that "" El Nino "" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several overall negative impact on agricultural production. Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle. Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists, it said. However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, and slow the decline in sugar production, it said. If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru ' s fishing industry could receive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 5. 5 mln tonnes in 1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said. Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said. It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March, April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest. "" There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino - - only time will tell, "" the report said.",0

"U. S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL / BEARISH U. S. Agriculture Department (USDA) figures for highly - erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish, although some said a full state - by - state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact. "" Out of 10. 5 mln acres only 1. 9 mln acres were accepted in corn - - That ' s neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for, "" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said. The USDA said it had accepted 10, 572, 402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11, 254, 837 acres. Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31. Indications of a heavy sign - up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63. 0 to 67. 0 mln acres from 67. 0 to 69. 0 mln. Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities, said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures. "" The 1. 9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing, "" he added. The USDA later released the state - by - state breakdown of the enrollment figures. Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures. Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring, he said: "" The corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign - up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60 ' s. Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres.

"ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986 / 87 soybean 10. 8 to 13. 8 pct higher than the 1985 / 86 record of 3. 34 mln hectares. The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm. Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates. The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts. In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged. The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.

"U. S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW U. S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years, Agriculture Department officials said. USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31. Agriculture Department analysts said next week ' s figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres, down 22 pct from last year ' s plantings of 83. 3 mln acres. Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U. S. corn production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels. Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program, along with 1. 9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain analysts said. "" There ' s no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage, "" one said. "" It ' s difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year. "" Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said. Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they said, compared to last year ' s level of 61. 5 mln acres. If analysts ' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u. s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment - In - Kind program. Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4. 2 billion bushels. Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels, down from last year ' s crop of 8. 3 billion bushels. "" This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production, "" an analyst said. A crop of seven and obtained average yields of 26. 5 bushels per acre. Last year U. S. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119. 3 bushels per acre. "" We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so, "" an analyst said. Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts said. Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage. "" To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to provide more incentives, "" an analyst said.",0

Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year ' s Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain. A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said. Dry weather in Argentina - - a major corn supplier to the USSR - - and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986 / 87 corn crop estimate this week to 11. 0 mln tonnes, down from 11. 5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500, 000 tonnes to 6. 8 mln tonnes. Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year ' s corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for April - June delivery to the USSR. "" Significant downside potential "" still exists for the Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow. "" If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period, "" he said. Current competitive prices for U. S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying. U. S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn for 67 dlrs - - a very competitive price spread, U. S. and Soviet sources said. "" This price difference makes American corn competitive, "" Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union, told Reuters.

With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize, sunflower and sorghum harvesting. Crops were considered in generally good condition, though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long - term damage.

Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3. 58 to 3. 78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3. 85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest. Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9. 9 and 10. 1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10. 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21. 1 to 22. 7 pct lower than the 12. 8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest, according to official figures.

"MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS Heavy rains fell again in Argentina ' s main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces. Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces. Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco. Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered. Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago. Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather. Estimates for total crop ranged from 2. 3 to 2. 6 mln tonnes, down from 2. 4 to 2. 7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34. 1 to 41. 5 pct from last year ' s record harvest of 4. 1 mln tonnes.

". A leading U. S. farm - state Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D - La. , warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year. "" We ' re moving toward a direction where we could self - destruct (the U. S. sugar program ), "" Rep. Huckaby, chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, who told U. S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject. Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons. "" I think if we ' re talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you ' re getting to the point where the program might not work, "" he said. "" Ideally, I ' d like to freeze things right where we are, "" said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress. A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6. 5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the U. S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U. S sugar imports holding at about 1. 2 mln tons, Huckaby said. A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said. "" I feel like if we didn ' t expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program ), "" Huckaby said. However, much depends on whether high - fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U. S. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said. He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U. S. But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then U. S. sugar imports might be eliminated and U. S. sugar output severely reduced. Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A. E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon. "" This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have some natural, legitimate self - interest in seeing that the program is preserved, "" Huckaby said. Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls. Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production.

"U. S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING Recent purchases of U. S. corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said. Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior - - which a dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel - - by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain. By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales, where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed. If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the Gulf corn basis. "" The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices, "" one dealer said. "" It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City, "" which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest. "" But we don ' t know when they might do it, "" an Ohio dealer said, which has created uncertainty in the market.

"., Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now. Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1. 1 billion dlrs, Myers said. The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R - Ill. Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically - influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist. The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20, 000 short tons raw sugar per grower. For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4. 5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1. 5 cts in 1991. The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said. Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry. He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads. U. S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a "" progressive contraction "" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing. Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar - containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar - containing products and a flight of U. S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar. USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U. S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar. "" Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing, "" Myers said.

"HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP Fresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986 / 87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said. They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops. The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province. The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue. The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains. In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay. In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm. The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa. Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said. The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added. Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces. The production forecast for 1986 / 87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2. 2 and 2. 4 mln tonnes, against 2. 3 to 2. 6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41. 5 to 46. 3 pct lower than the record 4. 1 mln tonnes produced last season. The area sown was two to 2. 2 mln hectares, down 29. 9 to 36. 3 pct on the record 3. 14 mln hectares in 1985 / 86. The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. was put at a record 7. 5 to 7. 7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7. 5 to 7. 8 mln tonnes. These figures are 4. 2 to 5. 5 pct higher than last season ' s record of 7. 2 to 7. 3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5. 6 to 8. 5 pct up on the official 7. 1 mln tonnes. The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said. Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further. The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season. Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid - April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.",0

S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA ' s price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates. He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week. Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums. He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease. The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices. When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted the idea. He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be emptied by the end of March.",0

"RAINS. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year ' s harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province ' s western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week ' s estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986 / 87 harvest was estimated at between 3. 58 and 3. 78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3. 85 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10. 4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17. 5 to 19. 4 pct over the 12. 4 to 12. 6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18. 9 to 21. 9 pct lower than last year ' s volume, according to official figures.

"AROUND 3. 5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0 / 92 A 0 / 92 program would have very little impact on U. S. allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment, would be most used by producers in high production / high risk areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins, director of USDA ' s economics analysis staff. "" In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much participation, "" Collins said. USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0 / 92, 1. 5 mln acres of corn, 500, 000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500, 000 acres of cotton. Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500, 000 bales of cotton, the report said. "" In determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate. .. The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered, "" according to the analysis. "" What you ' re giving up under 0 / 92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production, "" Collins said. For producers with low production costs, that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said. Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along with 0 / 92. But for high cost producers, 0 / 92 would be more attractive. Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0 / 92 program. "" I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments, "" Collins said. In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0 / 92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month.",1

"OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris - based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries, were provided to Reuters by officials of several The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U. S. , EC and Japan, the sources said. Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD work. Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May. Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva. British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture. He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture. However, the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials familiar with the study said. The U. S. Agriculture Department ' s Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982 - 84. In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD ' s, in part because farm policies in both the U. S. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982 - 84 from the OECD base period of 1979 - 81, U. S. officials said. For example, the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982 - 84, at 25 to 49 pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct. French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale, citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC. However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U. S. now because of increases since 1984. Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation. The updated calculations, which may take several months to complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U. S. subsidy levels for sugar because the U. S. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry. U. S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials added.",1

"" We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame, but we are locked into this, "" said Dan Glickman, (D - Kans. ), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains. "" We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer. A 0 / 92 plan, if properly done, could do both.

Rudy Boschwitz (R - Minn. ), cosponsor of the Boren / Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term 0 / 92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan. Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0 / 92 plan in the senate. His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions. "" I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but we can at least move in that direction, "" Boschwitz said. Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc. , testified in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias in U. S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers ' dependency on the government, he said. A 0 / 92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson said, and would still encourage farmers to plant. Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen ' s Association said their groups oppose any 0 / 92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers. But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0 / 92 program, Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0 / 92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.",1

"PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview. No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1. 8 to 1. 9 tonnes per ha to at least 2. 5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. Aziz said the current 1986 / 87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14. 5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14. 7 mln and last year ' s yield of 14. 0 mln. He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. The long - term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid - 1993, taking into account Pakistan ' s annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12. 5 mln tonnes. The current wheat reserve is 2. 5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said. Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3. 11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2. 85 rupees on March 30. Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side - products such as bran.",1

"OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris - based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries, were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified. The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979 - 81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent, PSE. The study shows that on dairy products Japan ' s PSE, or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged 83. 3 pct over 1979 - 81, with the European Community at 68. 8 pct and the United States 48. 2 pct. For wheat Japan ' s hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva. British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture. He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture. However, the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials familiar with the study said. The U. S. Agriculture Department ' s Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982 - 84. In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD ' s, in part because farm policies in both the U. S. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982 - 84 from the OECD base period of 1979 - 81, U. S. officials said. For example, the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982 - 84, at 25 to 49 pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct. French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale, citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC. However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U. S. now because of increases since 1984. Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation. The updated calculations, which may take several months to complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U. S. subsidy levels for sugar because the U. S. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry. U. S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials added.",1

"U. S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER The U. S. House Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union. The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year. In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar - containing products and tobacco. Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, Congressional sources said. The effect of the EEP amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U. S. quotas. The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R - Minn. , is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said. Another amendment would place a quota on U. S. imports of casein, a dairy product shipped to the U. S. primarily by New Zealand and Ireland. The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U. S. beef imports. Other miscellaneous amendments included: - - Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports. - - Boosting the amount of U. S. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800, 000 tonnes from 500, 000 tonnes now. - - Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non - tariff trade barrier. - - Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500, 000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U.

"USSR out of the U. S. Agriculture Department - - have been extremely tight - lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer. But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer, while not a "" done deal, "" is a live possibility. Prominent U. S. grain trade representatives - - many of whom asked not to be identified - - continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent. Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible, are saying they would not rule one out. Rep. Pat Roberts, R - Kan. , yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks. Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials. Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U. S. Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month. Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat. Some grain trade representatives say a four - mln - tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U. S. corn and open the door to U. S. sales of soybeans. As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price. Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat - - but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15 - dlr - per - tonne subsidy still left U. S. wheat prices far above world market prices. The administration ' s decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism, grain trade sources said. Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were "" chortling "" because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U. S. housewives. The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times in the U. S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer. In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U. S. wheat if it were priced more competitively. However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration ' s announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer. Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets, but also a",1

Tightening up on the use of generic (in - kind, or "" pik ') certificates will also be another option his committee will study, Glickman said.

FEEDGRAIN 0 / 92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION Advocates of a 0 / 92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English (D - Okla. ), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0 / 92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat. An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat, but supporters of a 0 / 92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled - down version would not be equitable for farmers. Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat, it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally, they said. If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then supporters of a 0 / 92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week, sources said. English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm (R - Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear. Agricultural aides to English said the congressman ' s first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill, they said. Under a 0 / 92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. Rep.",1

"CANADA is really getting pretty serious. We ' re talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it ' s worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop. "" Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices. Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board. If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada ' s grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference. The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet. Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.

"AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL, FORECASTER SAYS Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10. 40 mln hectares in 1987 / 88 from 11. 72 mln sown in 1986 / 87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast. But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987 / 88 would be less than the 16. 5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season. Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said. The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said.

"HOUSE 0 / 92 PLAN SEEN SCALED - BACK TO 1987 WHEAT Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale - back the 0 / 92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a broader 0 / 92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later, Congressional sources said. The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn English (D - Okla. ), and Dan Glickman (D - Kan.) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D - Tex.) which would limit 0 / 92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat. This would scale - back the 0 / 92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0 / 92 program for 1987 wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat. Under 0 / 92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments. Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0 / 92. The agreement to limit 0 / 92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0 / 92, and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill. Congressional sources said there has not been enough time crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1. 5 billion dlrs over five years. Another factor which could affect the 0 / 92 debate is the approach of planting season, Congressional sources said. Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0 / 92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains. If Congress approved 0 / 92 later in the year sign - up either would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.",1

"PUSHES 0 / 92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions. "" We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame, but we are locked into this, "" said Dan Glickman, (D - Kans. ), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains. "" We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer. A 0 / 92 plan, if properly done, could do both. "" Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0 / 92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week. Glickman said a 0 / 92 program, which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill - - only an extension of the 50 / 92 option already provided under the current bill. It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill, he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals, a voluntary 0 / 92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed. A 0 / 92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said. Decoupling - - delinking planting decisions from government payments - - is too much of a policy change to approve at this point, he said. "" I don ' t think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal, "" Glickman said at the hearing. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R - Minn. ), cosponsor of the Boren / Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term 0 / 92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan. Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0 / 92 plan in the senate. His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions. "" I know we cannot",1
"SEES the world market and increased consumption. Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved the wheat outlook. He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about 20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union. "" It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption to be in far better balance",1
"SAYS five main wheat exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U. S. In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production. A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems. The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries. They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period. This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said. The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production. The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses. These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency. For example between 1985 / 86 and 1986 / 87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209. 30 to 179. 44 European currency units (Ecus ). It dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says. The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in",1
"DRIVING, the U. S. Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U. S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33, 000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.

The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3. 4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3. 0 mln in the 1986 / 87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U. S. to be major supplier of the additional 400, 000",1

"USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department official said.

"" They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community, from Canada, from the U. S. They ' re active buyers from all sources at this point, "" the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes. This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U. S. corn for the first time in 15 years. A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U. S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow ' s recent interest. Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan to one of frenetic buying now, "" the official said. However, the situation in wheat is "" a different story, "" he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U. S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U. S. wheat less likely, he said. Speculation has continued for several days that the U. S. is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets, but U. S. officials have provided no confirmation.",1

"AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said. "" Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications, "" the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. "" Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia, "" it said. The commission is trying to identify ways of "" It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored, "" it said. For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW) might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly, southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong, in Victoria. Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said. The AWB said the current approach of state - based bulk handling authorities is not essential, although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained. An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26, 500 and 34, 700 U. S. Dlrs to load a 50, 000 - tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21, 200 dlrs at Houston and 16, 300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60, 000 - tonner.",1
"U. S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT / CORN SUPPLIES From April through December 1986, the Commodity said. The department said last summer, for example, certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped increase marketable supplies, so farm - level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel - - somewhat lower than they would have otherwise. The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels, it said. The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986 ' s 25. 8 billion dlrs. During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980 ' s will reverse. If current policy remains in force, annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year ' s record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said. The department said the President ' s budget proposals for 1988 - 1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs. In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2. 6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2. 4 pct average of 1980 - 86, it said. Partially because of this improvement, U. S. export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years, the department said.",1

The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U. S. market again. "" There has definitely been an evolving mind set - - from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now, "" the official said. However, the situation in wheat is "" a different story, "" he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.

"" Should the present drought continue, however, production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels, "" the letter added. Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels, or 1. 35 to 1. 65 mln tonnes of rice. Last year ' s output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985. The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed.

"HOUSE 0 / 92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0 / 92, or "" de - coupling, "" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who oppose 0 / 92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one - year 0 / 92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year. It is difficult to tell in what form the 0 / 92 provision will emerge from the committee, the sources said. Proponents of an expansion of 0 / 92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill - - ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs. Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill, committee staffers said. The 0 / 92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week. Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0 / 92 program, since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30. Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so something has to be done quickly if a 0 / 92 program is to be implemented, an Agriculture Department source said. An expansion of 0 / 92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week ' s subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman, D - Kan. , saying that more study of Stenholm ' s bill is not a rejection of 0 / 92, only of the timing, "" a congressional staff member said.

"U. S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT A statement yesterday by Secretary of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that U. S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for U. S. prices to be at world market levels, U. S. grain trade industry officials said. They said that Shultz ' s comments, while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action. In response to a query on what the State Department ' s position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U. S. is going to trade. The Soviet Union, the world ' s largest grain importer, has bought no U. S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the price was far above world market levels. A U. S. offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower told the farm leaders. "" That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets, "" he said. If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U. S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP, it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow, an industry lobbyst said. National Wheat Grower ' s officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary ' s comments. "" His comments were not discouraging, but they didn ' t in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP, "" an official with the wheat group said. The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "" there is significance in that fact that we haven ' t seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets. "" In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the officials said. An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets, said that the Shultz comments "" are consistent with what he (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist, "" but said they don ' t necessarily relate to the Soviet Union. Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz ' s statements. But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow. "" If he didn ' t say no, then there ' s a chance. This is potentially a positive development, "" a commodity source said.",1

"CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets. Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign - up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees. With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean / corn ratio of 2. 9 / 1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances. An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross - compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.",1

"AROUND 3. 5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0 / 92 A 0 / 92 program would have very little impact on U. S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3. 5 mln acres of cropland every year, according to a report from the Agriculture Department. The savings resulting from the additional 3 said Keith Collins, director of USDA ' s economics analysis staff. "" In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much participation, "" Collins said. USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0 / 92, 1. 5 mln acres of corn, 500, 000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500, 000 acres of cotton. Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500, 000 bales of cotton, the report said. "" In determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate. .. The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered, "" according to the analysis. "" What you ' re giving up under 0 / 92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production, "" Collins said. For producers with low production costs, that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said. Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along with 0 / 92. But for high cost producers, 0 / 92 would be more attractive. Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0 / 92 program. "" I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments, "" Collins said. In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0 / 92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month.",1

"EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U. K. DEMAND The European Commission ' s decision to release an additional 300, 000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said. Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage, pointing out that at this week ' s U. K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340, 000 tonnes but only 126, 000 tonnes were granted. The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand, they said wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores. A total of 2. 10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1. 59 mln tonnes. Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1. 0 mln tonnes, leaving about 753, 000 tonnes, traders said. This season ' s U. K.

S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets U, for all practical purposes, "" said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson, reflecting similar statements made by other analysts.",1
"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non - communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms - - the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC ). "" The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports, "" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India ' s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18. 53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India ' s 25. 65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985 / 86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984 / 85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non - convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3 offered to India, "" the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state - run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said. "" We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest, "" he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15, 000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars. But despite India ' s new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added. "" It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced, "" one trade source said. "" The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants. "" Another added, "" Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty. "" This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country ' s foreign trade policy. """,1

"U. S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER The U. S. House Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union. The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year. In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar - containing products and tobacco. Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, Congressional sources said. The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988. The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D - Kan. , also would increase funding for the program to 2. 5 billion dlrs from 1. 5 billion now. Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Glickman which instructs the U. S. Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate. The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by Rep. Bob Smith, R - Ore. , does not require the administration make an offer, but urges such action. The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn English, D - Okla. , requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.

"LIFTS trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln. The IWC 1986 / 87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere. The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987 / 88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect. At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off. Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U. S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise. After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987, the IWC said. Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986 / 87, the IWC said. It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.

"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries, chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving, a Reuter survey showed. They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords ' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non - members undermining the pacts. Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses, have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations. Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey showed. The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound, market - oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests. "" We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long - term trend is downward, "" official Administration policy states. The U. S. Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts. The U. S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries, the State Department said. U. S. Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working. U. S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement, U. S. Officials said. Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the world ' s top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case. Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96, 000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50, 000 from 70, 000. Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London, "" Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality, if there was full participation by producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously. "" But Baron added, "" No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn ' t stick to its obligations. .. The German approach is sceptical. We don ' t think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them. "" Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries. But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for "" intellectual honesty "" and "" objective criteria "" have grown. British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid. It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open - ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U. K. Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be. A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply. A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation, particularly regarding stocks. Indonesia ' s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta: "" These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical. . But it ' s another matter when there are structural problems. . But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith. "" Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements. "" The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work, "" Martinez Cuenca said. The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations ' capital goods.",1
"USSR ' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer. Administration officials - - in and out of the U. S. Agriculture Department - - have been extremely tight - lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer. But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer, while not a "" done deal, "" is a live possibility. Prominent U. S. grain trade representatives - - many of whom asked not to be identified - - continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent. Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible, are saying they would not rule one out. Rep. Pat Roberts, R - Kan. , yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks. Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials. Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U. S. Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month. Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat. Some grain trade representatives say a four - mln - tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U. S. corn and open the door to U. S. sales of soybeans. As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price. Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat - - but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15 - dlr - per - tonne subsidy still left U. S. wheat prices far above world market prices. The administration ' s decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism, grain trade sources said. Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were "" chortling "" because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U. S. housewives. The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times in the U. S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer. In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U. S. wheat if it were",1

". the Senate. Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0 / 92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U. S. Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure. USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration ' s proposed broad - scale revision of farm programs. The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received. To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring, although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay. USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs, largely because of reduced crop forfeitures. The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall ' s flooding. In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall. Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses. The administration said it opposed the bill because, by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance. USDA also said the 0 / 92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration ' s proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings. USDA said the 0 / 92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the requirement to compensate fully disaster - struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs",1
"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES - - USDA The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.

In its report on Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said. In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17. 8 mln tonnes in 1986 / 87 to 13. 5 mln in 1989 / 90.

"SAYS Soviet winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic, "" she said. "" But it ' s still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting. "" Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25 - 35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said. The bitter winter cold temperatures - - which broke record lows that had stood for four decades - - also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops, she said. However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover, which should have well - insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage. The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986 / June 1987 marketing year, primarily from Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia, Martell said. She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand. Last fall ' s dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture - depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy. Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports. However, she said the U. S. remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U. S. grain purchases of the 1986 / 87 season by buying 2. 25 mln tonnes of corn. Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U. S. is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand. In 1984 / 85, the U. S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55. 5 mln tonnes. But in 1985 / 86",1

"ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER The Soviet Union ' s winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said. Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the EF Hutton publication "" Global Crop News, "" said in her latest report that the Soviets may cover, which should have well - insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage. The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986 / June 1987 marketing year, primarily from Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia, Martell said. She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand. Last fall ' s dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture - depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy. Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports. However, she said the U. S. remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U. S. grain purchases of the 1986 / 87 season by buying 2. 25 mln tonnes of corn. Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U. S. is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand. In 1984 / 85, the U. S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55. 5 mln tonnes. But in 1985 / 86, the Soviet Union bought 29. 9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U. S. for only 24 pct of that total. While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986 / 87 was 22 mln tonnes, many U. S. grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25 - 28 mln tonnes, she said.",1

"U. S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT The U. S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP ), senior USDA officials said. However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future. "" The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again, "" an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "" But there just isn ' t much talk about it, informally or formally. "" Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.

The administration ' s interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet - level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U. S. Trade Representative ' s Office said. In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration ' s previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of "" calm, basic, factual economics. "" Another USDA official said there was "" not even an informal suggestion or hint "" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little - understood El Nino weather pattern, & lt; Accu - Weather Inc >, a commercial weather forecasting service, said. Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government officials and meteorologists said. Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months. Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added. Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for over 20 years, the paper said. The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers, it added. This has resulted in reduced hydro - electric power, causing shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said. Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China, media reports said. The People ' s Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February. The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984. Severe drought is affecting about one - third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country ' s tea crop, Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia, concern is growing about below - average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia ' s wheat belt, local Meteorological Bureau officials said. For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat, the prospect of a dry autumn / winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added. Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982 / 83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino, they said. Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia - Pacific region ' s disrupted weather patterns to any single cause, El Nino ' s role is being closely studied, they said. Accu - Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino ' event ' was unique. The El Nino does not always produce the half the normal rainfall during the current wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end. In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year. The year ' s secondary rains usually occur between April and June, although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.",1

"U. S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT / CORN SUPPLIES From April through December 1986, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3. 85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1. 8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U. S. Agriculture Department said. The department said an additional 4. 3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January - August, 1987. These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report. Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U. S. grain more competitive on world markets, it said. The department said last summer, for example, certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped increase marketable supplies, so farm - level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel - - somewhat lower than they would have otherwise. The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels, it said. The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986 ' s 25. 8 billion dlrs.

Officially, the 1986 maize harvest was estimated at 2.1 million tonnes, but only a fraction of it was marketed, with most of the grain consumed by growers. Meanwhile, the state-owned National Milling Corp (NMC) said it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in various parts of the country. NMC managing director John Rubibira said Tanzania has only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity, concentrated in Dar es Salaam, Arusha in the north and Iringa in central Tanzania. In addition, the country has 450,000 tonnes of flat storage capacity. Rubibira said the government plans to build new silos in the main maize-growing areas of Iringa, MAIZA, Rubeya and Rukwa.",0
"PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state-owned grain purchasing agency EPAC from participating in grain import tenders open to private traders. Barreto told reporters that his goal was to reinstate EPAC in tenders until all imports are liberalized in 1990. Following a lawsuit by private importers, the Lisbon Civil Court ruled earlier this month that EPAC was not allowed to participate in tenders as it had done.",0
"BIG US CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture Department's fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups. Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres, USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said. Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres. Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday. Not all bids are accepted, Hertz said, but the enrollment is expected to be high. As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is expected to lock the most enrollment in the Great Plains.",0

"CANADA CORN DECISION UNJUSTIFIED - YEUTTER U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said today that Canada's finding that U.S. corn imports are hurting Canadian farmers is ""completely unwarranted."" ""U.S. corn exports to Canada are so low that it is inconceivable that they are hurting Canadian corn farmers by any reasonable measure,"" Yeutter said in a statement. He said that if other countries follow Canada's lead, it could lead to ""an accumulation of protectionist measures around the world."" French corn farmers have recently indicated that they will challenge U.S. supplies of corn gluten to Europe. Yeutter said the U.S. would closely examine the Canadian decision and if the U.S. believes that the decision is not based on facts, ""appropriate responses will be evaluated carefully."" Yeutter did not say what steps the U.S. might take in response.",0
"Despite earlier upbeat signs, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage of development, and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and thus export stocks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. In its report on U.S. cereal export markets, the department said that South Africa's corn exports in the 1986-87 season (October-September) were estimated at 2.5 million tons, 40 percent more than the previous year. South Africa's resurgence as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts that at one point in 1983-84 forced South Africa to import 2.7 million tons of U.S. corn, the department said. Since those imports in 1983-84, the U.S. has faced increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan. However, if South Africa is perceived as lacking in available supplies, the department said that purchases of U.S. corn could be further stimulated.",0
"Senate Republican Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption until 2000. Dole told the National Corn Growers Association board that the proposal is being considered by a rural working group of Republican members of Congress and governors. Gasoline containing at least 10 percent ethanol will now receive a six-cent-per-gallon exemption from a nine-cent state excise tax, which expires at the end of 1992. Ethanol is produced mainly by some major agricultural companies, including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley. The exemption has helped boost ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the price of competing crude oil.",0
"The Soviet Union is rumored to have bought up to 1.5 million tons of U.S. corn this morning, export sources said. The amount has not been confirmed, but the talk was rife in trade. Gulf barge cash base jumped two to three cents this morning due to rumors expected to drive up futures prices today. Soviet Union recently bought more than 1.0 million tons of U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture before trade talks with U.S. agriculture officials. Buys being touted today were seen as a positive factor in light of a Soviet trade official's statement that the previous purchase satisfied short-term needs.",0
"The U.S. government said in a preliminary report last week that payments in kind, or PIK allowances, cost between five and 20 percent more than congressional spending, but administration officials, who did not want to be named, argue over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers. U.S. government officials, however, took up the issue with the report, saying they have no regard for the storage, handling and transportation of goods that go to the government. GAO then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said. The issue is an important one because congressional budget committees are known to restrict the use of allowances as a means of cutting spending. Agriculture under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley will testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee.",0
"MIDWEST CASH GRAIN - SLOW COUNTRY MOVEMENT Cash grain traders reported slow land movements of corn and soybeans in the Midwest, with even corn sales drying up from PIK-and-roll activity this week. Some traders said the USDA could further adjust the reported price of corn in the Gulf to take into account high barge freight rates, but added that the current plan will likely have a few weeks to see if it will work as hoped. Corn and soybean values continued to fall on the Illinois and MidMississippi River because of high barge freight rates. Elevators in Toledo and Chicago ended loading the first corn boats of the new shipping season, supporting spot values at those endpoints.",0
"CONCERN OVER ""EL NINO"" IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that ""El Nino"" could return to Peru, with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster that affected weather on several continents and caused widespread damage from floods and droughts, the U.S. Department of Agriculture official in Lima said in a field report. Continued heavy rainfall in the northern coastal region, flooding of several major rivers and mudslides have led to increased concern, according to the March 17 report. However, he said that official sources still believe that El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity this year. El Nino is a phenomenon that involves shifting winds and waters in the Pacific. The USDA report said that El Nino, which is currently being experienced, had no overall negative impact on agricultural production. Excessive rainfall in the Piura Pimolla cotton cycle region could reduce yields by about 20 percent as early as El Nino grows.",0
"MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE) will begin trading futures contracts on high fruity corn syrup on April 6, if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week. Pat Henderson, spokesman for MGE, said that the exchange expects a contract approval at Tuesday's CFTC meeting, which has been under review since the proposal was submitted by the exchange in December 1985. The proposed contract is based on 48,000-pound lots of high fructose syrup, the equivalent of a tank truck of the sweetener obtained from corn in wet grinding. The syrup, commonly referred to as HFCS-55, is most commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other beverages, and would be shipped by shipping certificate from the production facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, the symbol of the CFCS-15, would be traded between the ""large amounts of corn"" and the 1300 HUTS.",0
"US CONSERVATION FIGURES LAKE NEUTRAL / BEARISH US Agriculture Department (USDA) figures for highly erodable land included in the Conservation Reserve Program were considered neutral to bear strong by most cereal analysts, although some said a full breakdown of corn acreage was needed to assess the full price impact. ""Out of 10.5 million hectares, only 1.9 million hectares were accepted into corn - that is neutral at best and perhaps bearish what the trade was seeking,"" said Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert. USDA said it had added 10,572,402 hectares to the conservation program, which consists of bids for a total of 11,254,837 hectares. Gustafson said he would not change his estimate of planted ideas for corn as a result of the latest numbers, but some other analysts said they would slightly adjust their estimates.",0
"STRONG DEMAND FOR US CORN IN JAPAN - The U.S. Department of Agriculture said that Japan appears to be relying less on corn from China, Argentina, and South Africa and more on supplies from the United States. In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said that U.S. corn sales of nearly three million tons in the last seven weeks were about three times higher than in that period last year. Reports of Argentine shortages and the apparent unwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world market prices may have prompted Japanese buyers to turn to the United States for maize supplies, the department said.",0

Other U.S. options would be to challenge the decision in Canadian courts or take retaliatory action against Canadian goods, a lower U.S. trade official said. However, retaliatory action is an unlikely step, at least initially, this official said. At least, a decision on U.S. action is not expected after the ruling documents are received here later this week.",0

The deadline for a final determination is March 7. U.S. officials said they were encouraged by the outcome of a similar case involving European noodle imports, in which Canada ruled that noodle imports, which account for about 10 percent of the Canadian market, do not harm domestic producers. U.S. corn exports account for only about five percent of the Canadian market. Canada imposed a tariff of 1.05 dlrs per bushel on U.S. corn in November 1986, but reduced the tariff last month to 85 ct because the Canadian government said that U.S. subsidies to corn producers were lower than originally estimated by Canada.",0

"NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN 67 Argentina's exports have already been cut by 500,000 tons. A greater need than expected, competitive prices and political motivations could spark Soviet interest in U.S. corn, corn industry and government officials said. As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union had bought an additional 1.5 million tons of U.S. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet demand for U.S. corn likely. First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said recent speculation was that last year's Soviet grain crop would be revised to just 190 million tons instead of the 210 million tons announced, increasing Soviet demand for grain. A decline in Argentine corn harvest prospects could also affect Soviet corn purchases, said a source at the Department of Agriculture.

Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 million tons of grain in 1986, up from 5.97 million in 1985, but up from a record 16.15 million tons in 1982.

The 1987 grain production target is 405 million tons, up from 391 million in 1986.

"US FEEDGRAINS GROUP ATTACKS CANADA CORN RULING The US Feedgrains Council is surprised and disappointed by the decision of the Canadian Import Tribunal that corn imports from the US are materially damaging to Canadian maize producers, a Council spokesman said. ""At a time when the world is trying to liberalize trade in the new round of multilateral negotiations, it is incomprehensible that a country that would benefit so greatly from the removal of agricultural barriers to trade would threaten this process by yielding to pressure for protectionism,"" said Council President Darwin E.

"SIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) are expected to fall by over 65% this year after a prolonged dry spell, agricultural industry sources said. They said that maize deliveries from 1987 are expected to fall from 1.6 million tonnes last year to around 520,000 tonnes. Approximately 60% of the maize is supplied by large commercial farmers and the equilibrium of smallholders. Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980, sources say there is no risk of food shortages in Zimbabwe. While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000 tonnes, the GMB stockpile currently stands at about 1.8 million tonnes, meaning that even with the greatly reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.",0
"SOWIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987 Soviet soybean imports could reach or exceed one million tons between January and September of this year, according to the Oil World Newsletter. Oil World said it was likely that the Soviet Union would reduce its soybean imports and significantly increase its flour imports. At least 500,000 tons of soymeal could be shipped from the European Community and South America in the January / March quarter, with further large volumes expected to be imported from Argentina and Brazil in the quarters of April and July, it said. No figures for imports were given in the corresponding periods in 1986. The change made sense given the recent purchases of probably 250,000 tons of Western European and Polish rapeseed and large-volume butter imports expected from March onwards. Oil World said that significant losses of Soviet winter grain due to the recent severe frosts were likely behind the recent recovery of Soviet purchases of U.S. corn.",0

Harmful effects were observed in the fields, most of which had a yellowish-brown hue, indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated periods of frost.

Imports from the United States are estimated at 1.5 million tonnes, compared with just 150,000 tonnes estimated for 1986-87, the report said. After traveling to key wheat-growing areas and obtaining more information on cultivated areas, the total acreage was estimated at 290,000 hectares due to the drought.",1

"TEXAS WEEKLY CROP REPORT The Texas Weekly USDA state crop report said stormy winter weather limited field work before conditions later in the week. A blizzard caused some livestock deaths in the Panhandle, and cold, wet weather blanketed many areas. Windy weather followed dry fields and limited planting delays. Small grains made good progress despite cool temperatures that slowed growth. Additional moisture was required in some areas. Many fields booted and some began to leave. Wheat was rated fair at 16 pct, 56 pct good and 28 pct excellent. Planting of corn and sorghum was progressing, and soil preparation in the plains was ahead of schedule despite snowfall. Cotton planting in the Lower Valley was making progress.",1
"USDA DETAILS CONSERVATION CROP ENROLLMENT Farmers reported more than 6.5 million acres of program crops for the latest Conservation Reserve Program and about four million acres of unprogrammed crops, said the Department of Agriculture's Conservation Specialists. Soybean crops accounted for less than two million acres of unprogrammed crops, said a USDA analyst. Strong crops of unprogrammed crops in wheat states, a large percentage of which would be fallow and non-soybean crops, accounted for a large portion of the unprogrammed crops, the analyst said. Wheat and corn crops accounted for slightly more than 40 percent of the total 10,572,402 acres included in the ten-year program. USDA analysts gave the following breakdown of crops: -- Wheat 2,615,140 acres -- corn 1,892,764 acres -- 585,55,000 acres -- currently.",1
"The U.S. Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the duration of the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, through the 1990 budget year and urged the Reagan administration to offer wheat to the Soviet Union. Proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress. In addition to the amendments to the EEP, the committee approved several proposals that could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugary products and tobacco. These amendments, which affect imports, face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has general jurisdiction over the trade legislation, will reject them, Congress said. The effects of the EEP amendments would extend the lifespan of the program by five years rather than the current three years through the 1988 budget year. Changes offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan would increase funding for the program to $2.5 billion.",1
"SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER offer has been abandoned -- but most of the speculative deals in the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, though they have reached a new level of intensity ahead of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's visit to Moscow this month. Rumors of an imminent deal have extended to wheat markets as officials from the two countries held their customary biannual trade talks on grain in February. Moscow's decision at that time to re-enter the U.S. corn market reinforced perceptions of the warming outlook for agricultural trade. Shultz's statement two weeks ago that he would not be in the manner of a subsidy offer for wheat under the Export Enhancement Program, coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow, was interpreted by many in the grain trade here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration would be preparing a clear one.",1

"The unusually warm and dry weather in most parts of China is seriously affecting crops, said the New China News Agency, which said the drought has hampered rice cultivation in eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-growing areas, the agency said, adding that some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have suffered from drought for more than seven months. Dry weather has reduced the volume of water by more than 20 percent compared to last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers. Yangtze River headwaters are at their lowest level in a century, stranding many ships and making port maneuvers more difficult, it said.",1
"USDA Increases SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE The U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its estimate of Soviet grain imports in 1986-87 to 26 million tons from last month's forecast of 23 million tons. In its monthly USSR grain situation and forecast, USDA stated that the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the U.S. corn market and the continued purchase of wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers. USDA wheat imports were estimated at 15 million tons, one million more than last month and 700,000 tons less than the preliminary 1985-86 level. Soviet grain for feed demand was estimated at a record 129 million tons. Record or near-record livestock stocks, along with a dry case likely to reduce late-season grazing areas, and a cold winter have boosted feed demand, USDA said. 1986 USSR meat production and beef production rose by nearly 6 percent from January levels, compared with just prior to the cold winter.",1

Also pending is a bill that would extend the lifespan of the National Commission on Dairy Policy. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment to one of the bills that would suspend minimum planting requirements for all 1987 wheat, feed grain, cotton and rice producers, an aide said. Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 percent of their base area to be eligible for 92 percent of their deficiency payments.

In the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David Rogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a gradual increase in world trade with a slow rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows. He said that because wheat can be produced in many nations, wheat trade is a good barometer for world grain trade and could lead to more activity in other grain markets. Rogers said that global cereal prices have risen in real terms to their lowest levels in over a quarter of a century as producing countries reviewed their expensive price support measures and reduced their crop requirements.",1

"The US agricultural official in East Berlin said in a field report that there were indications that winter barley and winter wheat were being killed compared to 38,000 hectares last year. He said that the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north. The most severe damage was to plants above the ground, where there was little or no snow cover, he added. Heavy frost at night followed by sunlight during the day had led to some tremors, especially in well-developed plants and winter barley. As the soil surface thawed, some stagnant water had also appeared in the fields. The officer said that the removal of the damage this spring would probably require special measures in fields with damaged plants and thin stands.",1

However, there was no reason to believe that Australian production in 1987 / 88 would be below last year's 16.5 million tonnes, as last season's harvests in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields. Most of the decline in plantings was expected in Western Australia, while the state's average yields would be supported by the sowing of wheat on fallow and resting sites, the private forecaster said. The main reason for a low West Australian estimate was poor profit prospects under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states, wheat crops should be maintained, assuming that the rainfall is now below the 3.88 hectares AWF said farmers needed, although the average for June is not below the 3.88 hectares.",1

Farmers can put soybeans under the credit program if they choose to reduce the acreage, but they have no price guarantees. Given the price outlook for both commodities, traders believe that farmers want to stick to a safe bet rather than gamble on soybeans, although the new crop would become soybeans / corn quota 2.9 / 1 soybeans under normal circumstances.",1

"The U.S. Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the duration of the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, through the 1990 budget year and urged the Reagan administration to offer wheat to the Soviet Union. Proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress. In addition to the amendments to the EEP, the committee approved several proposals that could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugary products and tobacco. These amendments, which affect imports, face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has general jurisdiction over the trade legislation, will reject them, Congress said. The effects of the EEP amendments would extend the lifespan of the program by five years rather than the current three years through the 1988 budget year. Changes offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan would increase funding for the program to $2.5 billion.",1

Rumors of an imminent deal have extended to wheat markets as officials from the two countries held their customary biannual trade talks on grain in February. Moscow's decision at that time to re-enter the U.S. corn market reinforced perceptions of the warming outlook for agricultural trade.

"A marketing credit for U.S. wheat, feed grains, and soybeans would not help the surplus situation and would be extremely costly, said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.). ""I don't think I would support a marketing credit now,"" he told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Soybeans, and Feed Grains. Boschwitz was one of the original advocates of a marketing credit for cotton and rice, but has since focused on the decoupling legislation, the Boren / Boschwitiz Act. A market credit for grain and soybeans would encourage more production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much more expensive than current cotton and rice marketing credits, and would not significantly increase exports, he said.",1

""There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough, so it is likely vulnerable,"" said Krenzler. Accu meteorologist Dale Mohler said that cold air flowing from the north could bring temperatures into the mid-20s Fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on the development of a low-pressure area over southeastern Colorado that could stall the system. If it is hampered by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit Oklahoma and Texas as early as Monday morning. Temperatures could remain susceptible for up to eight hours in the mid-20s, Mohler said. Krenzler said that less than 10 percent of the wheat crop in Oklahoma has panicked. The closer to this stage, the more vulnerable the head of wheat is to cold weather, he said we can handle up to 26 degrees.",1
"Total food aid needs in 69 of the least developed countries declined in 1986 / 87 as demand declined in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the department said that cereal production in Sub-Saharan Africa reached a record high in 1986 / 87, with increases in almost all countries. However, food needs in Central America had increased, exacerbated by droughts and civil wars. Record wheat production in 1986 / 87 drove global wheat consumption to a new peak, and higher-yielding varieties were particularly effective where spring wheat was a common crop, the department said. However, developing countries in tropical climates such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Central America may not be well adapted to wheat production, and improved varieties were not the answer to rising food needs. Global per capita consumption of vegetable oil in 1986 / 87 would account for one percent of the third of the world's oil consumption during the year of 1986 / 87.",1

Recent requests for maize related to exports to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein with a maximum daily rebate of 141 ECU per tonne compared to a previous rebate of 20 ECU per day. The daily special rebate for maize was established in connection with a commitment by the Commission to grant rebates this season for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EU countries, as compensation for concessions to the US in the recent dispute over cereals sales to Spain. If the latest French applications are accepted as expected, this will determine the total amount of French maize exported in this context, which will be 25,500 tonnes.",1

"ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP US WHEAT The Soviet Union would probably be more interested in buying new crops than booking cereals for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy for U.S. wheat, George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company, told Reuters. ""Pillsbury assumes that they (the Soviets) will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy to which they can respond,"" Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agricultural education conference here. But if there are too many restrictions on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less than an expected subsidy of four million tons, he said. Hoffman said that Pillsbury's internal statistics would put Soviet wheat just two million if they had much more subsidies under a Chinese winter supply than if the Soviets said subsidies to Moscow are likely.

Releasing shares through allowances made U.S. cereals more competitive on world markets, it said. Last summer, for example, the department said that allowances for the remainder of the harvest year were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn, helping to increase marketable stocks, so that corn prices fell by an average of two dlrs per bushel at current levels - slightly lower than they otherwise would have do.The lower prices probably led to an increase in spending from 1980 to half of the 1989 budget spending to $2.00 billion.",1
